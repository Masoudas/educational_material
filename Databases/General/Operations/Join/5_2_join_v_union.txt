In unions, we put two tables right after each other, whereas in unions, we just mix two tables.

Consider the following example:

SELECT 28 AS bah
UNION
SELECT 35 AS bah;

  	Bah
1	28
2	35

Now, consider the join:

SELECT * FROM
(SELECT 38 AS bah) AS foo
JOIN
(SELECT 35 AS bah) AS bar
ON (55=55);

	foo	Bar
1	38	35
