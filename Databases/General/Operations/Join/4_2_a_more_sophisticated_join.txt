Consider the following join query, and notice how we append the first name and last name together.

sqlite> SELECT
   ...> a.first_name || ' ' || a.last_name AS author_name,  # First row of the view
   ...> b.title AS book_title       # Second row of the view
   ...> FROM author a
   ...> JOIN book b ON b.author_id = a.author_id
   ...> ORDER BY a.last_name ASC;
