Recall that to update a record, one uses the update command:

UPDATE author
SET first_name = 'Richard', last_name = 'Bachman'
WHERE first_name = 'Stephen' AND last_name = 'King';


We can also delete data as follows:
DELETE FROM author
WHERE first_name = 'Paul'
AND last_name = 'Mendez';

And also, don't forget the famous insert method for setting records in a database:
INSERT into TABLE VALUES(, , , )
