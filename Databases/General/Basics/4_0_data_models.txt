There are several types of data models in DBMS. 

-   Object based logical Models – Describe data at the conceptual and view levels.
        -   E-R Model (Entity-Relationship model)
        -   Object oriented Model

-   Record based logical Models – Like Object based model, they also describe data at the conceptual and view levels. These models specify logical structure of database with records, fields and attributes.

    -   Relational Model
    -   Hierarchical Model
    -   Network Model – Network Model is same as hierarchical model except that it has graph-like structure rather than a tree-based structure. Unlike hierarchical model, this model allows each record to have more than one parent record.

-   Physical Data Models – These models describe data at the lowest level of abstraction
