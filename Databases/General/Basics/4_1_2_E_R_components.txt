As shown in Figure2, an ER diagram has three main components:
    -   1. Entity
    -   2. Attribute
    -   3. Relationship

1. Entity
An entity is an object or component of data. An entity is represented as rectangle in an ER diagram.
For example: In Figure3 we have two entities Student and College and these two entities have many to one relationship as many students study in a single college. 

2. Weak Entity:
An entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and relies on the relationship with other entity is called weak entity. The weak entity is represented by a double rectangle. For example – a bank account cannot be uniquely identified without knowing the bank to which the account belongs, so bank account is a weak entity.


A bit more elaboration:
An entity type should have a key attribute which uniquely identifies each entity in the entity set, but there exists some entity type for which key attribute can’t be defined. These are called Weak Entity type. 

The entity sets which do not have sufficient attributes to form a primary key are known as weak entity sets and the entity sets which have a primary key are known as strong entity sets.

As the weak entities do not have any primary key, they cannot be identified on their own, so they depend on some other entity (known as owner entity). The weak entities have total participation constraint (existence dependency) in its identifying relationship with owner identity. Weak entity types have partial keys. Partial Keys are set of attributes with the help of which the tuples of the weak entities can be distinguished and identified.
