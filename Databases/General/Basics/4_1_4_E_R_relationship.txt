A relationship is represented by diamond shape in ER diagram, it shows the relationship among entities. There are four types of relationships:
1. One to One
2. One to Many
3. Many to One
4. Many to Many

1. One to One Relationship
When a single instance of an entity is associated with a single instance of another entity then it is called one to one relationship. For example, a person has only one passport and a passport is given to one person.

2. One to Many Relationship
When a single instance of an entity is associated with more than one instances of another entity then it is called one to many relationship. For example – a customer can place many orders but a order cannot be placed by many customers.

3. Many to One Relationship
When more than one instances of an entity is associated with a single instance of another entity then it is called many to one relationship. For example – many students can study in a single college but a student cannot study in many colleges at the same time.

4. Many to Many Relationship
When more than one instances of an entity is associated with more than one instances of another entity then it is called many to many relationship. For example, a can be assigned to many projects and a project can be assigned to many students.

-   Total Participation of an Entity set
A Total participation of an entity set represents that each entity in entity set must have at least one relationship in a relationship set. For example: In the below diagram each college must have at-least one associated Student.
