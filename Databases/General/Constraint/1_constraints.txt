Constraints enforce limits to the data or type of data that can be inserted/updated/deleted from a table. The whole purpose of constraints is to maintain the data integrity during an update/delete/insert into a table. In this tutorial we will learn several types of constraints that can be created in RDBMS.

    -   UNIQUE
    -   DEFAULT
