    NOT NULL:
NOT NULL constraint makes sure that a column does not hold NULL value. When we donâ€™t provide value for a particular column while inserting a record into a table, it takes NULL value by default. By 
specifying NULL constraint, we can be sure that a particular column(s) cannot have NULL values.

CREATE TABLE STUDENT(
    ROLL_NO INT NOT NULL,
    STU_NAME VARCHAR (35) NOT NULL,
    STU_AGE INT NOT NULL,
    STU_ADDRESS VARCHAR (235),
    PRIMARY KEY (ROLL_NO)
);
