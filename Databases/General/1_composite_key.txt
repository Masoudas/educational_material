Normally, and this is the convention, that we want a unqiue primary key. However, as often is the case, we may have several columns that together form a key, as the following example demonstrates:

cust_Id    order_Id    product_code    product_count
--------   --------    ------------    -------------
C01	   O001         P007           23
C02	   O123	        P007           19
C02	   O123	        P230           82
C01	   O001	        P890           42

As such, we have a case of composite primary key.
