The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions. This implies that we can't use functions in the where clause. 

Consider the following example.

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;

We need to count which countries have at least five customers. This is the perfect place to use databases.
