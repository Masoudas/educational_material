The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) 
to group the result-set by one or more columns.

Consider the following example:

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;

Here, we group consumers based on their country, and then we count them.

## A little note one group by.
This is me:

Conside we want the count of a table columns. So, this would be for example the count of repetitive ids in a table. I may write a querry like this:

SELECT COUNT(table_id.id) AS count, table_id.id FROM table_id GROUP BY table_id

Why is this the thing we seek? Because SQL (and we a priori!) understand that when we type this querry, we're actually counting the number of ids in THIS table, not the count of id in the original table_id (which is one for each row!) As such, we see that the counts are for this table, where the ids are grouped. Hence, this querry makes sense.
