The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) 
to group the result-set by one or more columns.

Consider the following example:

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;

Here, we group consumers based on their country, and then we count them.
