A direct way is as follows. The default postgres user and database are created in the entrypoint with initdb:

$ docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres

The postgres database is a default database meant for use by users, utilities and third party applications.


To define the username and password for an account, we can do as follows: 

$ docker run -it --rm --network some-network postgres psql -h some-postgres -U postgres

postgres=# SELECT 1;
 ?column? 
----------
        1
(1 row)
