ME: One thing to note is that aggregate function can be used directly without having to group by, in order to get some result. Consider the following table

$ CREATE TABLE T1 (
    price INT,
    count INT
)

We can directly use the aggregate (SUM, COUNT, etc) functions to create aggregate rows. This would give us the aggregates in a new table:

$ SELECT SUM(price), SUM(count) FROM T1;
# 100, 5000     -- For example!

However, if we were to use a value column together with aggregate functions, then we'd get an error yelling on us that we require a group by expression:

$ select SUM(price), price from person;

Why? Because it doesn't know which price goes with which sum. To remedy this, we need to use a group by:

$ select SUM(price), price from person group by;

In conclusion, when using aggregate function on the entire table, we'd get an aggregate and that's no problem. With value columns, however, we need to use group by.
