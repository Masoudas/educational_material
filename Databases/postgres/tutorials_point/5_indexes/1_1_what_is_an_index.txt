Suppose you need to look up John Doe‘s phone number in a phone book. Assuming that the names on the phone book are in alphabetical order, to find John Doe‘s phone number, you first look for the page where the last name is Doe, then look for the first name John, and finally, get his phone number.

If the names on the phone book were not ordered alphabetically, you would have to go through all pages and check every name until you find John Doe’s phone number. This is called a sequential scan which you go over all entries until you find the one that you are looking for.

Similar to a phonebook, the data stored in the table should be organized in a particular order to speed up various searches. This is why indexes come into play.

By definition, an index is a separated data structure that speeds up the data retrieval on a table at the cost of additional writes and storage to maintain the index.
