So far you have learned how to add values of one or more columns to an index. PostgreSQL partial index even allows you to specify the rows of a table that should be indexed. This partial index helps speed up the query while reducing the size of the index.

The partial index is useful in case you have commonly used WHERE conditions that use constant values as follows:

$ SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = constant_value;

ME: This is particularly useful if, for example, we're dealing with inactive clients or consumers.

$ CREATE INDEX idx_customer_inactive ON customer(active) WHERE active = 0;
