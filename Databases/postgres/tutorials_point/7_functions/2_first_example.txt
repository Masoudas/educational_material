Imagine the table 'film' that has the fields 
    -   *film_id
    -   title
    -   description
    -   release_year
    -   ...

Here's the syntax of a function that counts the films whose length between the len_from and len_to parameters.

ME: Notice how the result of calculation is poured into another variable, namely fil_count.

create function get_film_count(len_from int, len_to int)
    returns int
    language plpgsql
    as
$$
declare
   film_count integer;

begin
    select count(*)
    into film_count -- ME: Output is mostly the result of a select
    from film
    where length between len_from and len_to;   # Notice that we need a semicolon here.
    return film_count;  # Another semicolon here,
end;    # Another semicolon here.
$$

select film_count(60, 90) as 'film_count', ...
