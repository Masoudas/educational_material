PostgreSQL provides you with three ways to call a user-defined function:
    -   Using positional notation
    -   Using named notation
    -   Using the mixed notation.

1) Using positional notation:
In this case, we call the function inside a select statement:

$ select get_film_count(40, 60)

2) Using named notation:
In the named notation, we use the arrow operator:

$ select get_film_count(
    from_len => 40, 
    to_len => 60
)

3) Using mixed notation:
The mixed notation is a combination of the two syntax:
$ select get_film_count(
    40, 
    to_len => 60
)

Interestingly, like normal functions, we may not have named arguments before unnamed ones:
$ select get_film_count(
    from_len => 40, 
    60
)
