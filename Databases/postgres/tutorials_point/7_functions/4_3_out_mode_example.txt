The out parameters are defined as a part of the argument list and are returned back as a part of the result. The out parameters are very useful in functions that need to return multiple values.
To define out parameters, you explicitly precede the parameter name with the out keyword as follows:

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
create or replace function get_film_stat(
    out min_len int,
    out max_len int,
    out avg_len numeric) 
language plpgsql
as 
$$
begin  
  select min(length),
         max(length),
		 avg(length)::numeric(5,1)  -- Notice the type cast syntax.
  into min_len, max_len, avg_len
  from film;

end;
$$
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

One thing to note about this function is that because the return has many values, we need to unpack it, which requires the following syntax:

$ select * from get_film_stat();

Which essentially is a select all syntax.
