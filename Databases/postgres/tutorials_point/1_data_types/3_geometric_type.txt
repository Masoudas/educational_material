Geometric data types represent two-dimensional spatial objects. The most fundamental type, the point, forms the basis for all of the other types.

Name	Storage Size	Representation	Description
point	16 bytes	Point on a plane	(x,y)
line	32 bytes	Infinite line (not fully implemented)	((x1,y1),(x2,y2))
lseg	32 bytes	Finite line segment	((x1,y1),(x2,y2))
box	32 bytes	Rectangular box	((x1,y1),(x2,y2))
path	16+16n bytes	Closed path (similar to polygon)	((x1,y1),...)
path	16+16n bytes	Open path	[(x1,y1),...]
polygon	40+16n	Polygon (similar to closed path)	((x1,y1),...)
circle	24 bytes	Circle	<(x,y),r> (center point and radius)
