In the database world, NULL means missing information or not applicable. NULL is not a value, therefore, you cannot compare it with any other values like numbers or strings. The comparison of NULL with a value will always result in NULL, which means an unknown result. In addition, NULL is not equal to NULL so the following expression returns NULL:

NULL = NULL

Consider the following table:

CREATE TABLE contacts(
    id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Note that phone number may be null. The following statement returns no rows:

SELECT
    id, first_name, last_name, email, phone
FROM
    contacts
WHERE
    phone = NULL;

The statement returns no row. This is because the expression phone = NULL in the WHERE clause always returns false. Even though there is a NULL in the phone column, the expression NULL = NULL returns false. This is because NULL is not equal to any value even itself. As such, this query must always be written with 'IS NULL':

SELECT
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    email,
    phone
FROM
    contacts
WHERE
    phone IS NULL;
