Consider the following table:

REATE TABLE old_style
(
id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
val1 TEXT NOT NULL,
val2 TEXT NULL,
CONSTRAINT uq_val1_val2 UNIQUE (val1, val2)
);

Because nulls are treated as not-equal, we can insert many nulls in the table as follows:

$ INSERT INTO old_style (val1, val2)
SELECT ‘Hello’, NULL FROM generate_series(1, 5);

Thus, we see that We have filled five row with ('Hello', Null)!
