The DROP VIEW statement removes a view from the database. The following illustrates the syntax of the DROP VIEW statement:

$ DROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] view_name [CASCADE | RESTRICT]

In this syntax:

    -   First, specify the name of the view after the DROP VIEW keywords.
    -   Second, use the IF EXISTS option to drop a view only if it exists. If you donâ€™t use the IF EXISTS option and drop a view that does not exist, PostgreSQL will issue an error. However, if you use the IF EXISTS option, PostgreSQL issues a notice instead.
    -   Third, use the RESTRICT option to reject the removal of the view if there are any objects depending on it. The RESTRICT option is the default. If you use the CASCADE option, the DROP VIEW automatically drops objects that depend on view and all objects that depend on those objects.
