First, create a new updatable view name usa_cities using CREATE VIEW statement. This view contains all cities in the city table locating in the USA whose country id is 103.

$ CREATE VIEW usa_cities AS SELECT
	city,
	country_id
FROM
	city
WHERE
	country_id = 103;

Next, check the data in the usa_cities view by executing the following SELECT statement:
$ SELECT
	*
FROM
	usa_cities;

Now, consider inserting into this table:
$ INSERT INTO usa_cities (city, country_id) VALUES('San Jose', 103);

We may also delete from said view, which affects the underlying table:
$ DELETE
FROM
	usa_cities
WHERE
	city = 'San Jose';
