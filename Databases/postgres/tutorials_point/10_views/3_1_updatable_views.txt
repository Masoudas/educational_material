A PostgreSQL view is updatable when it meets the following conditions:

    -   The defining query of the view must have exactly one entry in the FROM clause, which can be a table or another updatable view.
    -   The defining query must not contain one of the following clauses at the top level: GROUP BY, HAVING, LIMIT, OFFSET, DISTINCT, WITH, UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.
    -   The selection list must not contain any window function , any set-returning function, or any aggregate function such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX.

An updatable view may contain both updatable and non-updatable columns. If you try to insert or update a non-updatable column, PostgreSQL will raise an error.

When you execute an update operation such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE, PosgreSQL will convert this statement into the corresponding statement of the underlying table.

In case you have a WHERE condition in the defining query of a view, you still can update or delete the rows that are not visible through the view. However, if you want to avoid this, you can use CHECK OPTION when you define the view.

When you perform update operations, you must have corresponding privilege on the view, but you donâ€™t need to have privilege on the underlying table. However, view owners must have the relevant privilege of the underlying table.
