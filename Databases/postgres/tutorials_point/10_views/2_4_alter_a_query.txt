To change the definition of a view, you use the ALTER VIEW statement. For example, you can change the name of the view from customer_master to customer_info by using the following statement:

$ ALTER VIEW customer_master RENAME TO customer_info;

PostgreSQL allows you to set a default value for a column name, change the viewâ€™s schema, set or reset options of a view.
