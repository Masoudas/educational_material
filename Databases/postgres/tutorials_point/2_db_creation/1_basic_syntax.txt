Postgres specifies two ways of creating a database (note that postgres is the root user of the db):

$ CREATE DATABASE mydb;

Or through the command line:

$ psql createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres testdb

ME: Does this mean this database is accessible on a different port? No, the host and port and U are where the postgres instance is running.

Note that we can list the database using \l:

#postgres: \l

We can select a database using the \c command:

#postgres:\c testdb;

Then, we may omit it:
#postgres: dropdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgress testdb
