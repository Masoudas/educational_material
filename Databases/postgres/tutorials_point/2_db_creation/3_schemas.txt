A schema is a named collection of tables. A schema can also contain views, indexes, sequences, data types, operators, and functions. Schemas are analogous to directories at the operating system level, except that schemas cannot be nested. PostgreSQL statement CREATE SCHEMA creates a schema.

Me: Hence, there's no schema1.schema2

Creating a schema is the same as creating a table:

$ CREATE SCHEMA schema1;

This of course changes the creation of tables. We need to supply the schema name:

$ CREATE TABLE schema1.table1(

);

We can do the same from the command line as well:
#testdb=# create schema myschema;
#testdb=# create table myschema.company(
   ID   INT              NOT NULL,
   NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
   AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
   ADDRESS  CHAR (25),
   SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),
   PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
