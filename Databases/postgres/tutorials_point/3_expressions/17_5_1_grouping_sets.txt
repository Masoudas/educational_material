A grouping set is a set of columns by which you group by using the GROUP BY clause. A grouping set is denoted by a comma-separated list of columns placed inside parentheses. For example, the following query uses the GROUP BY clause to return the number of products sold by brand and segment. In other words, it defines a grouping set of the brand and segment which is denoted by (brand, segement):

CREATE TABLE sales (
    brand VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    segment VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (brand, segment)
);

Here's a very big query, to calculate the quantity per brand, segement, brand and segment, and then total of products:

SELECT  brand, segment, SUM (quantity) FROM sales GROUP BY brand, segment

UNION ALL

SELECT brand, NULL, SUM (quantity) FROM sales GROUP BY brand

UNION ALL

SELECT NULL, segment, SUM (quantity) FROM sales GROUP BY segment

UNION ALL

SELECT NULL, NULL, SUM (quantity) FROM sales;

We can more easily write this query as follows, using group sets (me: Interestingly, and naturally if we think about it of course, the empty () means grouping by all columns.) This is more readable and is optimized better:

SELECT
    brand,
    segment,
    SUM (quantity)
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY
    GROUPING SETS (
        (brand, segment),
        (brand),
        (segment),
        ()
    );
