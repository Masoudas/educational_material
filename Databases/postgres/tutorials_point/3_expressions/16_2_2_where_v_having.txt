The WHERE clause allows you to filter rows based on a specified condition. However, the HAVING clause allows you to filter groups of rows according to a specified condition.

In other words, the WHERE clause is applied to rows while the HAVING clause is applied to groups of rows.

Example:
The following query uses the GROUP BY clause with the SUM() function to find the total amount of each customer:

SELECT
	customer_id,
	SUM (amount)
FROM
	payment
GROUP BY
	customer_id;

The following statement adds the HAVING clause to select the only customers who have been spending more than 200:

SELECT
	customer_id,
	SUM (amount)
FROM
	payment
GROUP BY
	customer_id
HAVING
	SUM (amount) > 200;
