To join the three tables, you place the second INNER JOIN clause after the first INNER JOIN clause as the following query. For more joins, you use the same technique:

SELECT
	c.customer_id,
	c.first_name customer_first_name,
	c.last_name customer_last_name,
	s.first_name staff_first_name,
	s.last_name staff_last_name,
	amount,
	payment_date
FROM
	customer c
INNER JOIN payment p 
    ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN staff s 
    ON p.staff_id = s.staff_id
ORDER BY payment_date;
