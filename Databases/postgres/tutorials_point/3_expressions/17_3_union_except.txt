Me: Except is like (A - B) for tables. 

Like the UNION and INTERSECT operators, the EXCEPT operator returns rows by comparing the result sets of two or more queries.

The EXCEPT operator returns distinct rows from the first (left) query that are not in the output of the second (right) query.

The following illustrates the syntax of the EXCEPT operator. (Me: Again, note that just like union, things work on a select stmt.)

$ SELECT * from table1 EXCEPT select * from table2

The queries that involve in the EXCEPT need to follow these rules:

The number of columns and their orders must be the same in the two queries.
The data types of the respective columns must be compatible.

We may also use an order by stmt:

SELECT * FROM top_rated_films EXCEPT SELECT * FROM most_popular_films ORDER BY title;

This would return the results sorted.
