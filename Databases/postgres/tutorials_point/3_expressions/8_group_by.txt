The PostgreSQL GROUP BY clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to group together those rows in a table that have identical data. This is done to eliminate redundancy in the output and/or compute aggregates that apply to these groups. The GROUP BY clause follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause.

    -   Syntax
The basic syntax of GROUP BY clause is given below. The GROUP BY clause must follow the conditions in the WHERE clause and must precede the ORDER BY clause if one is used.

SELECT column-list
FROM table_name
WHERE [ conditions ]
GROUP BY column1, column2....columnN
ORDER BY column1, column2....columnN

# SELECT NAME, SUM(SALARY) AS SALARY_GROUP FROM COMPANY GROUP BY NAME;
