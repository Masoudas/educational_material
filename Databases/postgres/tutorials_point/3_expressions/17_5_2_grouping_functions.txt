The GROUPING() function accepts an argument which can be a column name or an expression:

$ GROUPING( column_name | expression)

The column_name or expression must match with the one specified in the GROUP BY clause. The GROUPING() function returns bit 0 if the argument is a member of the current grouping set and 1 otherwise.

SELECT
	GROUPING(brand) grouping_brand,
	GROUPING(segment) grouping_segment,
	brand,
	segment,
	SUM (quantity)

FROM
	sales

GROUP BY
	GROUPING SETS (
		(brand),
		(segment),
		()
	)

ORDER BY
	brand,
	segment;

It returns 1 if the group is in the 'brand' group in the grouping brand, and 0 if the group is in the 'segment' group. Of course '1,1' means it belongs to both groups.
