The PostgreSQL UPDATE statement allows you to modify data in a table. The following illustrates the syntax of the UPDATE statement:

$ UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1,
    column2 = value2,
    ...
WHERE condition;


In this syntax:

    -   First, specify the name of the table that you want to update data after the UPDATE keyword.
    -   Second, specify columns and their new values after SET keyword. The columns that do not appear in the SET clause retain their original values.
    -   Third, determine which rows to update in the condition of the WHERE clause.

The WHERE clause is optional. If you omit the WHERE clause, the UPDATE statement will update all rows in the table. If executed successfully, it returns:

$ UPDATE count

Just like an insert, update also has a returning stmt.
