The HAVING clause specifies a search condition for a group or an aggregate. The HAVING clause is often used with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups or aggregates based on a specified condition.

PostgreSQL evaluates the HAVING clause after the FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and before the SELECT, DISTINCT, ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses.

SELECT
	column1,
	aggregate_function (column2)
FROM
	table_name
GROUP BY
	column1
HAVING
	condition;
