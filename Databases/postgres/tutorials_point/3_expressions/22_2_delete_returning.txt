To return the deleted row(s) to the client, you use the RETURNING clause as follows:

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition
RETURNING (select_list | *)

The asterisk (*) allows you to return all columns of the deleted row from the table_name. To return specific columns, you specify them after the RETURNING keyword.

    -   Note that the DELETE statement only removes data from a table. It doesnâ€™t modify the structure of the table. If you want to change the structure of a table such as removing a column, you should use the ALTER TABLE statement.

Note that the following statement deletes all rows of the table:

$ DELETE FROM links;
