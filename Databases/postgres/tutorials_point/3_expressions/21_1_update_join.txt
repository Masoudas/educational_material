Me: Note that this is different from 'insert from select'. Why? Because with this query, we can update another table, but where rows of one table equal those of another.

Sometimes, you need to update data in a table based on values in another table. In this case, you can use the PostgreSQL 'UPDATE join' syntax as follows:

$ UPDATE t1 SET t1.c1 = new_value FROM t2 WHERE t1.c2 = t2.c2;

To join to another table in the UPDATE statement, you specify the joined table in the FROM clause and provide the join condition in the WHERE clause. The FROM clause must appear immediately after the SET clause.

For each row of table t1, the UPDATE statement examines every row of table t2. If the value in the c2 column of table t1 equals the value in the c2 column of table t2, the UPDATE statement updates the value in the c1 column of the table t1 the new value (new_value).

Here's an example query, where we actually perform an operation in the update procedure:

$ UPDATE product SET net_price = price - price * discount FROM product_segment WHERE product.segment_id = product_segment.id;
