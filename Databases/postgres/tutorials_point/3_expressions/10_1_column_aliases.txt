A column alias allows you to assign a column or an expression in the select list of a SELECT statement a temporary name. The column alias exists temporarily during the execution of the query.

SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

Note AS is optional:
SELECT column_name alias_name
FROM table_name;
