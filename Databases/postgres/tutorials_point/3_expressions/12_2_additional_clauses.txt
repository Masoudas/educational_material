Postgres has:
    BETWEEN:	Return true if a value is between a range of values
    LIKE: LIKE	Return true if a value matches a pattern (used with tsvector type)

An example of between (me: between shortens the need to write to comparison clauses):

SELECT
	first_name,
	LENGTH(first_name) name_length
FROM
	customer
WHERE 
	first_name LIKE 'A%' AND
	LENGTH(first_name) BETWEEN 3 AND 5
ORDER BY
	name_length;
