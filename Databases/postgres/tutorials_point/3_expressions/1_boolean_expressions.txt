An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators, and PostgresSQL functions that evaluate to a value.

PostgreSQL EXPRESSIONS are like formulas and they are written in query language. You can also use to query the database for specific set of data.

Syntax
Consider the basic syntax of the SELECT statement as follows âˆ’

    -- Boolean expression
SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE SALARY = 10000;

    -- Numeric expression
SELECT (15 + 6) AS ADDITION;

There's also built-in expressions:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "RECORDS" FROM COMPANY;

    -- Date expressions
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
