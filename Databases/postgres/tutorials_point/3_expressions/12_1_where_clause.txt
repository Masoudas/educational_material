PostgreSQL evaluates the WHERE clause after the FROM clause and before the SELECT and ORDER BY clause.

FROM -> WHERE -> SELECT -> ORDER BY

If you use column aliases in the SELECT clause, you cannot use them in the WHERE clause (Me: This is clear in the order of execution, which is why we may use aliases in order_by clause, but not in where clause.).

Besides the SELECT statement, you can use the WHERE clause in the UPDATE and DELETE statement to specify rows to be updated or deleted.

To form the condition in the WHERE clause, you use comparison and logical operators
