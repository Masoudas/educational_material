The PostgreSQL DELETE statement allows you to delete one or more rows from a table. The following shows basic syntax of the DELETE statement:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

In this syntax:
    -   First, specify the name of the table from which you want to delete data after the DELETE FROM keywords.
    -   Second, use a condition in the WHERE clause to specify which rows from the table to delete.

The WHERE clause is optional. If you omit the WHERE clause, the DELETE statement will delete all rows in the table. The DELETE statement returns the number of rows deleted. It returns zero if the DELETE statement did not delete any row.
