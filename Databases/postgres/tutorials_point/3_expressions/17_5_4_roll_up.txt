The ROLLUP assumes a hierarchy among the input columns and generates all grouping sets that make sense considering the hierarchy. This is the reason why ROLLUP is often used to generate the subtotals and the grand total for reports.

The ROLLUP(c1,c2,c3) generates only four grouping sets, assuming the hierarchy c1 > c2 > c3 as follows:
(c1, c2, c3)
(c1, c2)
(c1)
()

A common use of  ROLLUP is to calculate the aggregations of data by year, month, and date, considering the hierarchy year > month > date

We may also do a partial roll-up:

SELECT
    c1,
    c2,
    c3,
    aggregate(c4)
FROM
    table_name
GROUP BY
    c1, 
    ROLLUP (c2, c3);
