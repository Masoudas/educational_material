PostgreSQL also provides the DISTINCT ON (expression) to keep the “first” row of each group of duplicates using the following syntax (Me: this would be in junction with a order statement). Consider:

CREATE TABLE distinct_demo (
	id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	bcolor VARCHAR,
	fcolor VARCHAR
);

SELECT
	DISTINCT ON (bcolor) bcolor,
	fcolor
FROM
	distinct_demo 
ORDER BY
	bcolor,
	fcolor;


Then, it will return the first row with distinct bcolor. Hence, if we have:

INSERT INTO distinct_demo (bcolor, fcolor)
VALUES
	('red', 'red'),
	('red', 'red'),
	('red', NULL),
	(NULL, 'red'),
	('red', 'green'),
	('red', 'blue'),
	('green', 'red'),
	('green', 'blue'),
	('green', 'green'),
	('blue', 'red'),
	('blue', 'green'),
	('blue', 'blue');

Then we get:
blue, blue
green, blue
red, blue
null, blue

Me: What's the difference with the given expression:
SELECT
	DISTINCT bcolor,
	fcolor
FROM
	distinct_demo 
ORDER BY
	bcolor,
	fcolor;

Fooled you! This expression means the pair (bcolor, fcolor) are distinct/
