The UNION operator combines result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set.

The following illustrates the syntax of the UNION operator that combines result sets from two queries (ME: As we can see, we unionize two select stmts):

$ SELECT select_list_1 FROM table_expresssion_1 UNION SELECT select_list_2 FROM table_expression_2

To combine the result sets of two queries using the UNION operator, the queries must conform to the following rules:

    -   The number and the order of the columns in the select list of both queries must be the same.
    -   The data types must be compatible.

The UNION operator removes all duplicate rows from the combined data set (meaning keeps only one of them). To retain the duplicate rows, you use the the UNION ALL instead.
