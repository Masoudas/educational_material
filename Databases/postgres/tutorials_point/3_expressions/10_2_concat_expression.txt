The following query returns the full names of all customers. It constructs the full name by concatenating the first name, space, and the last name:

SELECT 
   first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name

FROM 
   customer;

result:
full_name
Aaron Ramsy
Roger Federer

Note that in PostgreSQL, you use the || as the concatenating operator that concatenates one or more strings into a single string.
