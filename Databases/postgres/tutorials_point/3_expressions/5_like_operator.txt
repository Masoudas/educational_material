The PostgreSQL LIKE operator is used to match text values against a pattern using wildcards. If the search expression can be matched to the pattern expression, the LIKE operator will return true, which is 1. 

There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator −
    -   The percent sign (%)
    -   The underscore (_)

The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple numbers or characters. The underscore represents a single number or character. These symbols can be used in combinations.

If either of these two signs is not used in conjunction with the LIKE clause, then the LIKE acts like the equals operator.

Syntax
The basic syntax of % and _ is as follows −:

1	        WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '200%'
            Finds any values that start with 200

2	        WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '%200%'
            Finds any values that have 200 in any position

3	        WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '_00%'
            Finds any values that have 00 in the second and third positions

4	        WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '2_%_%'
            Finds any values that start with 2 and are at least 3 characters in length

5	        WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '%2'
            Finds any values that end with 2

6	        WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '_2%3'
            Finds any values that have 2 in the second position and end with a 3

7	        WHERE SALARY::text LIKE '2___3'
            Finds any values in a five-digit number that start with 2 and end with 3

NOTE: The ::text is the type cast. Hence, SALARY which is an integer column is converted to a text column to allow search on a number! An actual query be like:

$ SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE::text LIKE '2%';
