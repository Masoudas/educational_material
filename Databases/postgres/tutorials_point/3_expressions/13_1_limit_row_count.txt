PostgreSQL LIMIT is an optional clause of the SELECT statement that constrains the number of rows returned by the query.

The following illustrates the syntax of the LIMIT clause:

    SELECT select_list 
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY sort_expression
    LIMIT row_count

The statement returns row_count rows generated by the query. If row_count is zero, the query returns an empty set. In case row_count is NULL, the query returns the same result set as it does not have the LIMIT clause.

In case you want to skip a number of rows before returning the row_count rows, you use OFFSET clause placed after the LIMIT clause as the following statement:

SELECT select_list
FROM table_name
LIMIT row_count OFFSET row_to_skip;

Of course, if we wanted to get the last rows, we'd use order descending, and then limit.
