The common format of exists is as follows:

SELECT 
    column1
FROM 
    table_1
WHERE 
    EXISTS( SELECT 
                1 
            FROM 
                table_2 
            WHERE 
                column_2 = table_1.column_1);

Note that if the subquery returns NULL, the result of EXISTS is true. Only if it returs no rows, then is the result false.

Example: Find consumers who have at least one payment greater than some amount (me: why not use an inner join here?):

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM customer c
WHERE EXISTS
    (
        SELECT 1
        FROM payment p
        WHERE p.customer_id = c.customer_id AND amount > 11 )
ORDER BY first_name, last_name;
