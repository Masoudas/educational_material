If we write a normal select for geometries, then we'd get a binary represention. We need to use the "ST_AsText" function to see geometries as proper texts.

SELECT ST_AsText(geom) from geometries;

We may also see the 'x' and 'y' coordinates as follows (only works for points):
SELECT ST_X(geom), ST_Y(geom) from geometries;
