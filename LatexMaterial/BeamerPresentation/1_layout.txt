Note that overleaf also has a very nice documentation on beamer.

A frame can contain one slide or multiple slides.

\begin{document}

\usetheme{Warsaw}   % The theme of the beamer.
\usecolortheme{crane}   % Changes the color theme.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To use a custom color theme, define name and color as follows:
\definecolor{my_theme}{rgb=0.125,0.5,0.25}  % Use latexcolor.com to find different nice color themes.

Then instead apply the following command for color theme:
\usecolortheme[named=my_theme]{structure}       % structure means use custom color theme. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Frame Title}
Text inside frame       % Text is automatically centered.
\end{frame}

\end{document}

A more sophisticated theme is as follows:
\usetheme[progressbar=frametitle]{metropolis}    % The metropolis theme showing frame progress bar.
                                            % If you look closely, progress bar appears under each frame's title, moving forward
                                            % based on number of pages passed so far.
\setbeamertemplate{frame numbering}[fraction]  % Shows the slide number as a fraction
\useoutertheme{metropolis}
\useinnertheme{metropolis}
\usefonttheme{metropolis}
\usecolortheme{spruce}
\setbeamercolor{background canvas}{bg=white}
