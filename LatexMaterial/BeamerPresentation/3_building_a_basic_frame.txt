Now, inside each frame, we can work as follows.

Note that by default, the content is aligned in the middle. If we didn't want that, we need to work with the alignment bracket
of frame:
\begin{frame}[?]{Title here}\vspace{10pt}    % ? = t for top, b for bottom. We're optionally using vspace to change space to top.

Don't forget to use $$ to write math equations inside the text if you need to.

\begin{frame}{Title here}

\begin{enumerate}   % To create bullet points
    \item This is item 1

\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
With enumerate, note that we can change the bullets as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[(A)]  % Displays A, B, ... inside paranthesis.
Also, don't forget to use \small, \scriptsize to change the font size of subenumerations if needed.

Finally, note that if we have several bullet points that don't fit in one page, we can break them down, using the multicol package
as follows:

\usepackage{multicol}

\begin{document}

\begin{enumerate}
\begin{multicols}{3}
\item ...
\end{multicols}
\end{enumerate}
