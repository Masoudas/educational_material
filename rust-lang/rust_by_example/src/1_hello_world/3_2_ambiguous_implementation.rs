/*
fmt::Display may be cleaner than fmt::Debug but this presents a problem for the std library. How should ambiguous types be displayed? For example, if the std library implemented a single style for all Vec<T> , what style should it be? Would it be either of these two?

    -   Vec<path> : /:/etc:/home/username:/bin (split on : )
    -   Vec<number> : 1,2,3 (split on , )

No, because there is no ideal style for all types and the std library doesn't presume to dictate
one. fmt::Display is not implemented for Vec<T> or for any other generic containers. fmt::Debug must then be used for these generic cases. This is not a problem though because for any new container type which is not generic, fmt::Display can be implemented.
