As we already mentioned, the menuconfig is compiled with the help of kconfig files. Hence, it's natural to assume that we can add 
or remove items to the kernel using this file. And why would we want to do this? Suppose for example we develop some device driver,
then we can use this feature to add it to menuconfig.

Notice in the following table, the location of the kconfig file for each submenu:
The main menu, the initial screen                                   Kconfig

x86; in general, the Kconfig file is here: arch/<arch>/Kconfig)     arch/<arch>/Kconfig
