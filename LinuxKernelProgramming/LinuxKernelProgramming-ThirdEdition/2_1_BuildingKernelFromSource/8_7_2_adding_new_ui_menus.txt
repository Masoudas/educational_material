As an example, here we add an optional menu in the main menu, using the kconfig file. 

#1: Always get a backup file:
$ cp init/Kconfig init/Kconfig.old
$ vi init/Kconfig
...
config DEFCONFIG_ASS
        bool "This is my property"      
        default n
        help
                Thus, Masoud was able to define a property for menuconfig all by
        himself.
...
Note that we've defined a by state property here as such, and that the default is set to n. If we set our option to y, then we'll 
see it in the .config file under the property DEFCONFIG_ASS.
