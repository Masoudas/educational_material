To see the kernel version number, simply run uname -r on your shell. How do you precisely interpret the output of uname -r? On our 
Ubuntu distribution version 18.04 LTS guest VM, we run uname(1), passing the -r option switch to display just the current kernel 
release or version:

$ uname -r  # r stands for release
5.8.0-50-generic

The modern Linux kernel release number nomenclature is as follows:
major#.minor#[.patchlevel][-EXTRAVERSION]

The square brackets around the patchlevel and EXTRAVERSION components indicate that they are optional. The following table 
summarizes the meaning of the components of the release number:

Release # component	Meaning	Example numbers
Major # (or w)  :	Main or major number; currently, we are on the 5.x kernel series, thus the major number is 5. Example:	
                    2, 3, 4, and 5
Minor # (or x)  :	The minor number, hierarchically under the major number. Example: 0 onward
[patchlevel] (or y) :	Hierarchically under the minor number – also called the ABI or revision – applied on occasion to the stable 
                        kernel when significant bug/security fixes are required. Example:	0 onward
[-EXTRAVERSION] (or -z) :	Also called localversion; typically used by distribution kernels to track their internal changes.	
                            Varies; Ubuntu uses w.x.y-'n'-generic
