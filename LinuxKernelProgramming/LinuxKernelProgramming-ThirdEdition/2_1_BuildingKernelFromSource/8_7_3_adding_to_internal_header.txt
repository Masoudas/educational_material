When we add a property as such to the menuitem, it has not been added to kernel header files. In fact, we can check that it's 
NOT been added by the following simple grep:

$ grep "DEFCONFIG_ASS" include/generated/autoconf.h

Note: This header file is generated once we run the kernel configuration:
$ make -j4

Once we run this command, then we can check this autoconf.h to see that our symbol has been generated:
#define DEFCONFIG_ASS 1

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Note: Ok!!! Now we understand the need for these symbols. These are just definitions used to turn some functions inside the 
autoconf header on/off. Hence, if we want to use our own property, we need to have it defined somewhere inside the header! Then 
we use this definition to define a function for example or use it:

#ifdef DEFCONFIG_ASS
my_kernel_function();
#endif

Note that the Linux community has certain restrictive conditions on how to write code for kernel in the following link:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html. For example, the above piece of code should in fact be replaced 
by the following line:

if (IS_ENABLED(DEFCONFIG_ASS)){
    my_kernel_function();
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now, so far, we've only defined our header. But the actuall object file that contains the code need to be put somewhere. This is 
where the Makefile comes in. Say our code is in a file defconfig_ass.c, then we add the following like to the Makefile (of any
folder where the code exists:)

obj-${CONFIG_DEFCONFIG_ASS}  +=  defconfig_ass.o    # Add this object file to linker path. Recall that make finds the file and 
                                                    # compiles it.
