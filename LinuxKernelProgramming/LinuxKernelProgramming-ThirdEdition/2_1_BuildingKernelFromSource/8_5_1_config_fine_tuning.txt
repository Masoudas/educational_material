After acquiring a basic kernel configuration, it's possible to fine tune it, in particular using menuconfig. The target that's 
created with 'make menuconfig' is in 'scripts/kconfig/mconf'.

Sometimes, weird errors are printed, so that we won't be able to run the menuconfig. For example, consider running menuconfig for 
the first time:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
$ make menuconfig
UPD     scripts/kconfig/.mconf-cfg
 HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/mconf.o
 YACC    scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c
/bin/sh: 1: bison: not found
scripts/Makefile.lib:196: recipe for target 'scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c' failed
make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c] Error 127
Makefile:539: recipe for target 'menuconfig' failed
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We see here for example that the bison package does not exist, and we need to just install it. Then it may ask for 'sudo apt-get 
install flex', and then 'sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev' package.

Note: It's usually not recommended to directly edit the .config file, as we're not aware of all subdependencies, and just setting
one property to true might not set the subproperties to true as well.
