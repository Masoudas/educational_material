As always of course, we need a proper compiler which would allow us to compile the kernel for an ARM architecture. We can build 
a compiler using the famous xtools toolkit for the particular processor of raspberrypi. However, an easier option would be to 
just install one on our system using the standard package manager, which in this case would be:
$ sudo apt-get install ​crossbuild-essential-armhf      # For 32 bit architecture.
$ sudo apt install ​crossbuild-essential-arm64          # For 64 bit architecture.

Another method of getting a toolchain is to directly get one from the RaberryPi material and build it:
$ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools

As always, never forget to update the path variable to enable the compiler to be found.

Another resource is to check the link https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads.
to get a proper compiler from GNU resources.
