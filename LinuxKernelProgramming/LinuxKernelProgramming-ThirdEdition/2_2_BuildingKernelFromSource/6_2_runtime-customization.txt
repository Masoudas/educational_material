It's possible to customize the GRUB menu at run-time as well. For example, go to the "Advanced options for Ubuntu", and then go 
on the kernel version that you desire. By pressing e, we enter the "edit" environment.

After doing so, we can see several things, for example the parameters being passed to the linux kernel in front of the blinking
'_'. For example, if we remove the words 'quite' or 'splash' from this entry, then all the messages and logs of the kernel would
appear the next time we boot the kernel.
