A superb tool for tracing and profiling is the powerful Linux Tracing Toolkit next generation (LTTng) toolset, a Linux Foundation 
project. LTTng allows you to trace both userspace (applications) and/or the kernel code paths in minute detail. This can tremendously 
aid you in understanding where performance bottlenecks occur, as well as aiding you in understanding the overall code flow and thus 
in learning about how the code actually performs its tasks.

In order to learn how to install and use it, I refer you to its very good documentation here: https://lttng.org/docsâ€‹ 
(try https://lttng.org/download/ for installation for common Linux distributions). It is also highly recommended that you install the 
Trace Compass GUI: https://www.eclipse.org/tracecompass/. It provides an excellent GUI for examining and interpreting LTTng's 
output.
