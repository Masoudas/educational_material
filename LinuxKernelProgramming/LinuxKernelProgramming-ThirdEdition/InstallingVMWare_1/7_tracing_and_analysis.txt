An extension of the well-known Berkeley Packet Filter or BPF, eBPF is the extended BPF. (FYI, modern usage of the term is simply to 
refer to it as BPF, dropping the 'e' prefix). Very briefly, BPF used to provide the supporting infrastructure within the kernel to 
effectively trace network packets. BPF is a very recent kernel innovation â€“ available only from the Linux 4.0 kernel onward. It 
extends the BPF notion, allowing you to trace much more than just the network stack. Also, it works for tracing both kernel space 
as well as userspace apps. In effect, BPF and its frontends are the modern approach to tracing and performance analysis on a Linux 
system.

To use BPF, you will need a system with the following:

-   Linux kernel 4.0 or later
-   Kernel support for BPF (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#kernel-configuration)
-   The BCC or bpftrace frontends installed (link to install them on popular Linux distributions: 
    https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#installing-bcc) Root access on the target system

Using the BPF kernel feature directly is very hard, so there are several easier front ends to use. Among them, BCC and bpftrace are 
regarded as useful. Check out the following link to a picture that opens your eyes to just how many powerful BCC tools are available 
to help trace different Linux subsystems and hardware:

Important: You can install the BCC tools for your regular host Linux distro by reading the installation instructions here: 
https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md. Why not on our guest Linux VM? You can, when running a distro kernel 
(such as an Ubuntu- or Fedora-supplied kernel). The reason: the installation of the BCC toolset includes (and depends upon) the 
installation of the linux-headers-$(uname -r) package; this linux-headers package exists only for distro kernels (and not for our 
custom 5.4 kernel that we shall often be running on the guest).
