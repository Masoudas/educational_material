As we may have noticed, it's hard to search for items by hand. So instead what we can do is to search for them with forward slash,
just like in vim.

So, when we search for an item (like procfs,) then the following menu will appear:
...
Symbol: SND_VERBOSE_PROCFS [=y]                                         │  
  │ Type  : bool                                                            │  
  │ Defined at sound/core/Kconfig:139                                       │  
  │   Prompt: Verbose procfs contents                                       │  
  │   Depends on: SOUND [=y] && !UML && SND [=y] && SND_PROC_FS [=y]        │  
  │   Location:                                                             │
  │     -> Device Drivers                                                   │  
  │       -> Sound card support (SOUND [=y])                                │  
  │         -> Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (SND [=y])                 │  
  │ (3)       -> Sound Proc FS Support (SND_PROC_FS [=y])  
...

As we can see, it will first write a symbol that matches what we seek. Then, it will show the type, where in the kernel code base 
it's defined, and finally the location in the menuconfig. Notice that it also shows the dependencies.

Note: This information is found inside the Kconfig files in the source code, which are actually the files that are used for generating
the menuconfig itself. Notice that for example in above, it says that the symbol is defined at sound/core/Kconfig
