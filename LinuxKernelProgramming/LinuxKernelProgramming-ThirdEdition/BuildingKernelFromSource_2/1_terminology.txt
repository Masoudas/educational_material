A vanilla kernel: By vanilla kernel, we mean the plain and regular default kernel source code released by the Linux kernel community 
on its repository, https://www.kernel.org

Note that any Linux system, be it a supercomputer or a tiny embedded device, has three required components: 
    -   a bootloader    :   Responsible for providing hardware information for the kernel (three stages in arm335x)
    -   an Operating System (OS) kernel :   The kernel, loaded into memory, managing system resources.
    -   and a root filesystem   :   The file system of linux.

In this chapter, we concern ourselves only with the building of the Linux kernel from source. We do not delve into the root 
filesystem details, and (in the next chapter) learn to minimally configure the (very x86-specific) GNU GRUB bootloader.
