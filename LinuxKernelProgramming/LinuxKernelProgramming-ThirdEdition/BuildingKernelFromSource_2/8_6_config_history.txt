Everytime we make changes to our config file, the previous version is stored in a file on the same path called .config.old. So,
we can compare the differences using for example the diff tool.

However, diff tool is hard to use generally, and the kernel provides a script in scripts/diffconfig to this end. If we just type 
it out with help, we get:
$ ./scripts/diffconfig --help
...
Diffconfig is a simple utility for comparing two .config file
...
Added and removed items are shown with a leading plus or minus, respectively.
Changed items show the old and new values on a single line.

If -m is specified, then output will be in "merge" style, which has the
changed and new values in kernel config option format.
...
If no config files are specified, .config and .config.old are used.

Example usage:
 $ diffconfig .config config-with-some-changes
-EXT2_FS_XATTR  n
 CRAMFS  n -> y
 EXT2_FS  y -> n
 LOG_BUF_SHIFT  14 -> 16
 PRINTK_TIME  n -> y
