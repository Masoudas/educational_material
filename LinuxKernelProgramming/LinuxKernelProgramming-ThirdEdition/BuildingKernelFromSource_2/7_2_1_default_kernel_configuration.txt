The kernel will handle the details, giving us a default configuration. The downside is that the default config is really pretty 
large (here, we mean with reference to building Linux for an x86-based desktop or server-type system) â€“ a huge number of options are 
turned on, just in case, which can make the build time very long and kernel image size very large. Of course, you are then expected 
to manually configure the kernel to the desired settings.

This brings up the question, where is the default kernel config stored? (Me: Because the default parameters need to have been written
somewhere on the kernel folder to be retrieved.) The kbuild system uses a priority list fallback scheme to retrieve a default 
configuration. The priority list and its order (first being highest priority) are specified within init/Kconfig:DEFCONFIG_LIST (Me:
This means the symbols are inside the Kconfig file:)

$ cat init/Kconfig
config DEFCONFIG_LIST
    string
    depends on !UML 
    option defconfig_list
    default "/lib/modules/$(shell,uname -r)/.config"
    default "/etc/kernel-config"
    default "/boot/config-$(shell,uname -r)"
    default ARCH_DEFCONFIG
    default "arch/$(ARCH)/defconfig"
config CC_IS_GCC
