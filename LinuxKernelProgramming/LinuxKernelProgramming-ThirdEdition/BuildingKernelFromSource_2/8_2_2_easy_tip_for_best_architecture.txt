If we run the 'make help' command on the target architecture, we'll find the best matching default configuration. The only issue 
is that my CPU is x86_x64 (Intel) and this command is meant for foreign CPUs. However, running the commands gives an interesting 
option:

$ make help
...
  i386_defconfig              - Build for i386
  x86_64_defconfig            - Build for x86_64
...

Hence, we can use these options to build the kernel for x86_64.
