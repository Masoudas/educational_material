If we run the 'make help' command on the target architecture, we'll find the best matching default configuration. The only issue 
is that my CPU is x86_x64 (Intel) and this command is meant for foreign CPUs. However, running the commands gives an interesting 
option:

$ make help
...
  i386_defconfig              - Build for i386
  x86_64_defconfig            - Build for x86_64
...

Hence, we can use these options to build the kernel for x86_64.

Note: Notice the difference between the following two commands:
$ make --help
$ make help

The first one is the help of the make command, which is written for Linux. The second one on the other hand is the help target 
designed for the Kernel. It's the latter that has the information we seek.
