A common misconception, especially in its baby years, was that the Linux kernel is developed in a very ad hoc fashion. This is not 
true at all! The kernel development process has evolved to become a (mostly) well-oiled system with a thoroughly documented process 
and expectation of what a kernel contributor should know in order to use it well. I refer you to the preceding link for the complete 
details.

As mentioned earlier, as of the time of writing, the 5.4 kernel is the latest Long-Term Stable (LTS) version, so we shall use it in 
the materials that follow. So, how did it come to be? Obviously, it has evolved from the release candidate (rc) kernels and the 
previous stable kernel release that precedes it, which in this case would be the v5.4-rc'n' kernels and the stable v5.3 one before it. 
We use the git log command as follows to get a human-readable log of the tags in the kernel Git tree ordered by date. Here, we are 
only interested in the work that has lead to the release of the 5.4 LTS kernel, hence we have deliberately truncated the following 
output to reveal only that portion:

$ git log --date-order --graph --tags --simplify-by-decoration --pretty=format:'%ai %h %d'

Aha! In the preceding code block, you can clearly see that the stable 5.4 kernel was released on 24 November 2019 and the 5.3 tree on 
15 September 2019 (you can also verify this by looking up other useful kernel resources, such as 
https://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxVersions).

Kernel development workflow â€“ the basics
Here, we provide a brief overview of the typical kernel development workflow. Anyone like you who is interested in kernel development should at least minimally understand the process.

I refer you to the preceding link for the complete details.

In order for us to take a peek into a typical development cycle, let's assume we have the latest mainline Linux Git kernel tree cloned on to our system.

The details regarding the use of the powerful git(1) Source Code Management (SCM) tool is beyond the scope of this book. Please see the Further reading section for useful links on learning how to use Git. Obviously, I highly recommend gaining at least basic familiarity with using git(1).

The git log command (that we use in the following code block, and in fact any other git sub-commands) will only work on a git tree. We use the following one purely for demonstrating the evolution of the kernel. A bit later, we will show how you can clone a Git tree.

Aha! In the preceding code block, you can clearly see that the stable 5.4 kernel was released on 24 November 2019 and the 5.3 tree on 15 September 2019 (you can also verify this by looking up other useful kernel resources, such as https://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxVersions).

For the development series that ultimately led to the 5.4 kernel, this latter date (15 September 2019) marks the start of what is 
called the merge window for the next stable kernel for a period of (approximately) two weeks. In this period, developers are allowed 
to submit new code to the kernel tree (in reality, the actual work would have been going on from a lot earlier; the fruit of this 
work is now merged into mainline at this time).

Two weeks later (on 30 September 2019), the merge window was closed and the rc kernel work started, with 5.4-rc1 being the first of 
the rc versions, of course. The -rc (also known as prepatch) trees work primarily on merging patches and fixing (regression) bugs, 
ultimately leading to what is determined by the chief maintainers (Linus Torvalds and Andrew Morton) to be a "stable" kernel tree. 
The number of prepatches (-rc releases) varies. Typically, though, this "bugfix" window takes anywhere between 6 to 10 weeks, after 
which the new stable kernel is released. In the preceding code block, we can see that eight release candidate kernels finally resulted 
in the stable release of the v5.4 tree on 24 November 2019 (taking a total of 70 days).

The same can be seen more visually via the releases page at https://github.com/torvalds/linux/releases
