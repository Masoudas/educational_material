For a developer like working on and looking to contribute code upstream, you must work on the very latest version of the Linux kernel code 
base. Well, there are fine gradations of the latest version within the kernel community. As mentioned earlier, the linux-next tree, and 
some specific branch or tag within it, is the one to work on for this purpose.

The nlink to this tree can be found on the Linux website, where we click on browse, and it takes us to the git log. There, we can just download
the repo by clicking on the url of the page and then just git cloning it:

$ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/

The difference between this tree and that of Linus Tarvold's is that this tree is closer to the bleeding-edge (allegedly)

Here's how to download from his source tree:

$ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git

As the Linux repo is giant, we might want to limit it to a particular history depth when cloning:

$ git clone --depth n https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
