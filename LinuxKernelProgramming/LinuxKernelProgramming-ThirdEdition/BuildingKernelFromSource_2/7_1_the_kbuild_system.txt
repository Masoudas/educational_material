Naturally, kbuild stands for Kernel build. The kbuild system ties together the complex kernel configuration and build process via 
four key components:
    -   The Config_<X> symbols, where X is a symbol name.
    -   The menu specification file(s), called Kconfig  (which we do using make menuconfig)
    -   The Makefile(s)
    -   The overall kernel config file itself

    - What is a Config_<X> symbol:
Every kernel configurable X is represented by a CONFIG_X macro. Depending on the user's choice, the macro will resolve to one of y, 
m, or n:
    - y=yes: Implying to build the feature into the kernel image itself
    - m=module: Implying to build it as a separate object, a kernel module
    - n=no: Implying not to build the feature

Note that CONFIG_X is an alphanumeric string (as we will soon see, you can look up the precise config option name by using the make 
menuconfig option, navigating to a config option, and selecting the < Help > button).

Me: Note that these are the options we provide in the config menu, precisely as y, m or n. The interesting about m is that it's 
compiled as a separate module.

    - What is Kconfig
This is where the CONFIG_FOO symbol is defined. The kbuild syntax specifies its type (Boolean, tristate, [alpha]numeric, and so on) 
and dependency tree. Furthermore, for the menu-based config UI (invoked via one of make [menu|g|x]config), it specifies the menu 
entries themselves. The docs can be found at https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt

Me: If we cat the Kconfig on the root menu, we see that it points to various subfolder Kconfig files. Those subfolder files are the 
ones that determine how the kernel is configured and contain the symbols discussed above. For example, the net or mm folder contain 
one Kconfig file themselves.

    - What are Make files 
The kbuild system uses a recursive Makefile approach. The Makefile under the kernel source tree root folder is called the top-level 
Makefile, with a Makefile within each sub-folder to build the source there. The 5.4 vanilla kernel source has over 2,500 Makefiles 
in all.

    - What is The .config file
Ultimately, the essence of it – the actual kernel configuration – is generated and stored within the kernel source tree root folder 
in an ASCII text file called .config. Keep this file safe, it's a key part of your product.

Note: If we specify a kernel with menuconfig, when saving or exiting, it will ask us to put the configuration in this file. As the 
book says, the key thing is to get ourselves a working .config file.
