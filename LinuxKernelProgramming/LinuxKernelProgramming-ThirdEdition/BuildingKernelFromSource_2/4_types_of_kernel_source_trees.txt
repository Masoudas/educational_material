There are several types of Linux kernel source trees. The key one is the Long Term Support (LTS) kernel. It’s simply a "special" 
release in the sense that the kernel maintainers will continue to backport important bug and security fixes upon it (well, security 
issues are typically nothing but bugs), until a given EOL date.

The "life" of an LTS kernel will usually be a minimum of 2 years, and it can go for several more (it's extended at times). The 5.4 
LTS kernel that we will use throughout this book is the 20th LTS kernel and has a lifespan of just over 6 years – from November 2019 
to December 2025.

Me: If we go on the Release menu of the kernel.org, we see that the last LTS is version 5.10, EOL of 2022. Hence, not every stable
release (like 5.12 that I'm using right now) is LTS.

There are several types of release kernels in the repository. However, here, we mention an incomplete list, ordered from least to 
most stable (thus, their life, from shortest to longest time span):

    -   next trees: This is indeed the bleeding edge, subsystem trees with new patches collected here for testing and review. This 
        is what an upstream kernel contributor will work on.
    -   Prepatches, also known as -rc or mainline: These are release candidate kernels that get generated prior to a release.
    -   Stable kernels: As the name implies, this is the business end. These kernels are typically picked up by distributions and 
        other projects (at least to begin with). They are also known as vanilla kernels.  
    -   Distribution and LTS kernels: Distribution kernels are (obviously) the kernels provided by the distributions. They typically 
        begin with a base vanilla/stable kernel. LTS kernels are the specially maintained-for-a-longer-while kernels, making them 
        especially useful for industry/production projects and products.
    -   Super LTS (SLTS) kernels: Even longer maintained LTS kernels (by the Civil Infrastructure Platform 
        (https://www.cip-project.org/), a Linux Foundation project).
