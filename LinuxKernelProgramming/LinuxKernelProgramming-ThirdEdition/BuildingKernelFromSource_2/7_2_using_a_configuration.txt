There are three ways through which we can generate a configuration for our kernel:
    -   Use the default configuration shipped with the kernel
    -   Use the configuration of the existing kernel
    -   Specify a configuration 

Interestingly, the latter makes an interesting exercise, but often when working on a production line, we have a specific need for 
kernel, hence, it's not often used.

From the list, you can see that the kbuild system first checks for the presence of a .config file in the "/lib/modules/$(uname -r)" 
folder. If found, the values there will be used as the defaults. If not found, it next checks for the presence of a 
/etc/kernel-config file. If found, the values there will be used as defaults, and if not found it moves on to the next option in 
the preceding priority list, and so on. Note, though, that the presence of a .config file in the root of the kernel source tree 
overrides all of this!

Me: The folder /lib/modules/$(uname -r) does exist on my current linux version! But it has no .config file.
