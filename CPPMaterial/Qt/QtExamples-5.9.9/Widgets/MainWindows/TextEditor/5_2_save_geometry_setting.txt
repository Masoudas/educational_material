Of course, we need to save the geometry for the next use of the application. This can be done by writing the
settings, by querrying the geometry from the QApplication method of course:

void MainWindow::writeSettings()
{
    QSettings settings(QCoreApplication::organizationName(), QCoreApplication::applicationName());
    settings.setValue("geometry", saveGeometry());
}
