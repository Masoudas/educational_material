The header QGuiApplication and the corresponding class are responsible for the flow of a GUI application,
as opposed to QCoreApplication, which is responsible for the flow of a non-Gui application.

Note that we need gui added in the .pro file of the project.

In fact, we don't directly use this class to jump start a QTGuiApplication, but a QApplication class can be
converted to a REFRENCE of this class (don't forget not to slice.)

For example, in the following small snippet, we get the pid of the GUI application using this class:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#include "mainwindow.h"

#include <QApplication>
#include <QDebug>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    QApplication a(argc, argv);

    QGuiApplication& app = a;
    auto pid = app.applicationPid();
    qDebug() << pid;

    qDebug() << app.

    MainWindow w;
    w.show();
    return a.exec();
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
