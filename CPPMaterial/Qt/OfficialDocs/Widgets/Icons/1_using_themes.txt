Instead of adding a resource file for every inidividual action or button, sometimes it's useful to just use 
predefined theme icons in Qt. Some examples include:

    -   document
    -   document-open
    -   document-save
    ...

So, I can actually add these directly in the GUI design menu. Another option would be to use the QIcon class
directly, and in particular its static fromTheme menu:

QIcon::fromTheme("document-new", QIcon(":/images/new.png"));
