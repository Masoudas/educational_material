Widgets respond to events that are typically caused by user actions. Qt delivers events to widgets by calling 
specific event handler functions with instances of QEvent subclasses containing information about each event.

If your widget only contains child widgets, you probably do not need to implement any event handlers. If you 
want to detect a mouse click in a child widget call the child's underMouse() function inside the widget's 
mousePressEvent().

The documentation contains more information on this, but I skipped it.
