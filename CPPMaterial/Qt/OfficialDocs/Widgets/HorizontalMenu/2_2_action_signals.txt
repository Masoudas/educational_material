The list of signals associated are:

    -   void 	changed()
        This signal is emitted when an action has changed. If you are only interested in actions in a given 
        widget, you can watch for QWidget::actionEvent() sent with an QEvent::ActionChanged.

        When a change happens to enable/disable menu

    -   void 	hovered()
        This signal is emitted when an action is highlighted by the user; for example, when the user pauses 
        with the cursor over a menu option, toolbar button, or presses an action's shortcut key combination.
        This is a convenience slot that calls activate(Hover).

    -   void 	toggled(bool checked)
        This signal is emitted whenever a checkable action changes its isChecked() status. This can be the 
        result of a user interaction, or because setChecked() was called. As setChecked() changes the QAction, 
        it emits changed() in addition to toggled().

    -   void 	triggered(bool checked = false)
        This signal is emitted when an action is activated by the user; for example, when the user clicks a menu 
        option, toolbar button, or presses an action's shortcut key combination, or when trigger() was called. 
        Notably, it is not emitted when setChecked() or toggle() is called.
