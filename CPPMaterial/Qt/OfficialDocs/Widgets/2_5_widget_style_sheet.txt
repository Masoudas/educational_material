In addition to the standard widget styles for each platform, widgets can also be styled according to rules 
specified in a style sheet. This feature enables you to customize the appearance of specific widgets to 
provide visual cues to users about their purpose. For example, a button could be styled in a particular way to 
indicate that it performs a destructive action.

The use of widget style sheets is described in more detail in the Qt Style Sheets document.
