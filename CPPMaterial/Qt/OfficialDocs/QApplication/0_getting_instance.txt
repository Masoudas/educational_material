As only one instance of QApplication is allowed to be constructed, we can access this instance using the instance
method of the class. 

In the following snippet, we connect a signal of our UI class called clicked to the quit slot of the QApplication
class:

class UI : QObject
{
Q_Object
    UI(QWidget* parent = nullptr){
        QObject::Connect(this, &UI::clicked, QApplication::instance(), &QApplication::quit);
    }
...

}
