The class hierarchy of Qt is shown. It's interesting to note that QWidget is the parent level of all (let's say things.) 

QMainWindow as an example inherits from QWidget. 

Widgets are able to respond to events and use parenting system and signals and slots mechanism. All widgets inherit from QObject. The most 
basic widget is the QWidget. QWidget contains most properties that are used to describe a window, or a widget, like position and size, mouse 
cursor, tooltips, etc.

Above all, however, the fact that everything inherits from QObject is the most important point of figure1.
