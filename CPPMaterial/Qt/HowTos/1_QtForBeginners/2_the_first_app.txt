QApplication is a very important class. It takes care of input arguments, but also a lot of other things, and most notably, the event loop. 
The event loop is a loop that waits for user input in GUI applications.

#include <QApplication>

int main(){
    QApplication app;
    app.exec();
}

Me: Now, every widget it seems can be presented as part of the GUI, not necessarily the main window.

In this application, we add something to be displayed:

#include <QApplication>
#include <QPushButton>

int main(){
    QApplication app;
    QPushButton button("Hello World");

    button.show();  // Show the button.
    app.exec();
}
