Qt objects have a lot of attributes that can be modified using getters and setters. In Qt, if an attribute is called foo, the associated getter 
and setter will have these signatures:

T foo() const;
void setFoo(const T);

In fact, Qt extends this system of attributes and getters and setters to something called property. A property is a value of any type that can 
be accessed, be modified or constant, and can notify a change. The property system is useful, especially in the third part (QML). For now, we 
will use "attribute" or "property" to do the same thing.

A QPushButton has plenty of properties:
    -   text
    -   font
    -   tooltip     # A help text that appears when we push a button.
    -   icon
    -   ...

For example, in our previous simple example, we can set the text and tooltip as follows:

#include <QApplication>
#include <QPushButton>

int main(){
    QApplication app;

    QPushButton button;
    button.setText("Hello World");
    button.setToolTip("A simple push button");
    button.show();
    
    app.exec();
}
