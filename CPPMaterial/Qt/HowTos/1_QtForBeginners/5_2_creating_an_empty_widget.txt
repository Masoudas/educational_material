Widgets are not abstract class an can be instantiated by themselves. For example, below we create a widget and setFixedSize of it. Then we 
place a button inside of it.

The documentation of the method says "Sets both the minimum and maximum sizes of the widget to s, thereby preventing it from ever growing or 
shrinking."

#include <QApplication>
#include <QPushButton>

int main(){
    QApplication app;

    QWidget window;
    window.setFixedSize(100, 50);

    QPushButton *button = new QPushButton("Hello World", &window);
    button->setGeometry(10, 10, 80, 30);

    window.show();
    return app.exec();

}
