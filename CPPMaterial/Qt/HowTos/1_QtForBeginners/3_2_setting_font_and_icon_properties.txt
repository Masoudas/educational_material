To set the font properties, we need to pass a QFont object.

The documentation provides a lot of information. We are especially concerned here with one of the constructors of QFont:
QFont(const QString & family, int pointSize = â€“1, int weight = -1, bool italic = false)

For example, a font name is "Courier". Hence, we set the font of the button as follows:

QFont font("Courier");

QPushButton button;
button.setFont(font);

We can also set the icon of the button either from a path, or from a resource file, or from default path:

QIcon icon("path_to_icon");
QIcon icon(":/resource_file");
QIcon icon = QIcon::fromTheme(const QString &name, const QIcon &fallback = QIcon());    // Fallback is in case the theme is not found.

button.setIcon(icon);
