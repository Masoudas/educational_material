Let's start from the basics. Assume that the text has been modified, and we just want to write the plain text
content into a file. How do we go about that?

Well, first of all, we need to open the file (assuming it exists.) Then, we need to get the text from our plain
text editor. Finally, we need to stream it into the file.

Well, like before, we can open a TEXT file for WriteOnly mode using the QFile object. Then, we can once again
use the QTextStream to stream text to the file, and then directly stream the text into the file.

void saveFile(const QString& fileName){
    QFile file(fileName);
    if(!file.open(QFile::WriteOnly | QFile::TextFile)){
        QMessageBox::warning(this, tr("Application"),
                        tr("Cannot write file %1:\n%2.")
                        .arg(QDir::toNativeSeparators(fileName),
                            file.errorString()));
    }

    QTextStream out(&file);

    out << ui->plainTextEditor->toPlainText();


}
