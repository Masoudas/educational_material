/**
 * Qt Quick declares a number of basic data types; these match closely with the data types you find in Qt when 
 * writing C++ code, although the syntax can differ. Some of the most important types you'll encounter are as 
 * follows:
 *  -   A point, with the x and y properties.
 *  -   A rectangle, with x, y, width, and height properties.
 *  -   A size, with width and height properties.
 *  -   A color, which is a quoted string in the HTML ARGB notation or a named color from Qt's lexicon of colors. 
 *      (Most colors you can think of have names in QML.)
 *  -   A 2D, 3D, or 4D vector.
 *  -   Basic types, including Boolean values, strings, integers, and floating-point numbers.
 * 
 * See https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmlreference.html.
