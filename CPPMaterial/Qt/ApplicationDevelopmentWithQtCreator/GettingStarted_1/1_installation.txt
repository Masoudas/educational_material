As always, we can either build from source, or install directly.

In particular, in Ubuntu, we can use package manager to install qtcreator:
sudo apt-get install qtcreator qt5-default

This however, does not seem to work properly, and the best way to do so is to use the installer of qt.
It will install all the libraries and qtcreator.
