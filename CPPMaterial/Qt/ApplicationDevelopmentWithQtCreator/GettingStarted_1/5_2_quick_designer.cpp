/**
 * While the basic concepts and principles are similar, the Qt Quick designer is actually very different 
 * from the Qt Widgets designer due to the very nature of it â€“ the Qt Quick designer is specially optimized 
 * for creating touch-based applications, while Qt Widgets is designed for creating desktop programs. 
 * 
 * For example, you'd probably write an enterprise data collection application using Qt Widgets, while you'd 
 * create a media center application using Qt Quick.
 * 
 * To create a new quick designer file, we must create new file.
