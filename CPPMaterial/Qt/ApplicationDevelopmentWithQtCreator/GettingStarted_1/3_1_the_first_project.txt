We first create a console application. Choose Application, then Qt Console Application, and then click on 
Choose.

Qt asks for the build system, which for now we set to qmake. We shall use cmake later on as well.

Qt Creator can support various kits and libraries against which you can build an application. Select the 
desktop Qt Kit, which should have been installed by default. If you're running Qt on Windows, please make 
sure that you select the desktop Qt Kit with MinGW, as it is installed by default. Make sure that you have 
installed Microsoft Visual Studio beforehand if you pick the desktop Qt MSVC Kit. Then, click on Next.

Note: We may need to manually define the qmake and Qt version in the settings of this step.
