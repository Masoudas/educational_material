/**
 * We have four types of layouts:
 *  -   Horizontal layout: Widgets are horizontally stacked
 *  -   Vertical layout: Widgets are vertically stacked
 *  -   Grid layout: Widgets are arranged in a grid that can be subdivided into smaller cells
 *  -   Form layout: Widgets are arranged like a web form, a label, and an input.
 * 
 * A basic layout will try to constrain all its widgets to occupy equal surfaces. It will either change the 
 * widgets' shape or add extra margins, depending on each widget's constraints. Check Box will not be 
 * stretched but Push Button will.
 * 
 * We can rename our layouts to point to them. We can essentially rename every object from the top right
 * hand window in the designer form, including the main window.
