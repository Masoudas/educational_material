/**
 * In addition to viewing and changing variable values, you can view and change individual memory locations. You 
 * might want to do this if you're debugging a decoder or encoder for a binary format, for example, where you 
 * need to see a specific location in the memory. From the variables pane, you have several choices by which you 
 * can check a memory location:
 * 
 *  -   You can right-click on a given variable and open a memory window at this variable's address.
 *  -   You can right-click on a given variable and open a memory window at the value that the variable points 
 *      to (in other words, dereference a pointer to a memory location).
 *  -   You can right-click on the variable pane and open up a memory browser at the beginning of the current 
 *      stack frame.
 *  -   You can right-click on the variable pane and open up a memory browser at an arbitrary location in the 
 *      memory.
