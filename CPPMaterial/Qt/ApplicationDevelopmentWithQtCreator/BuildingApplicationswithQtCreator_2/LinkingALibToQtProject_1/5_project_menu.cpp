/**
 * Note that Qt creater is a very well cross-platform build environment. As such, it has build and run environment
 * for various platforms.
 * 
 * If you click on the Projects button on the left of Qt Creator, you'll see the project's options, which consist 
 * of the following:
 *      -   The Build & Run options
 *      -   The Editor options
 *      -   The Code Style options
 *      -   Dependencies
 * 
 * The final thing that you should know is the build and run kit selector.
 * 
 * To support this, Qt has the notion of a build kit, which is just the headers, libraries, and associated things to 
 * support a specific platform. You can install multiple build kits and choose which build kit you're compiling 
 * against by choosing Open Build and Run Kit Selector.
 * 
 * To install other development kits, we can use the qt installer directly. The older versions and their development
 * kits and their corresponding installers can be found on the qt website.
