/**
 * Virtually any modern system combines multiprocessing with multithreading, courtesy of multi-core CPUs, 
 * which combine two or more processing cores on a single processor die. What this means for an operating 
 * system is that it has to schedule tasks both across multiple processing cores while also scheduling 
 * them on specific cores in order to extract maximum performance. 
 * 
 * This is the area of task schedulers. Suffice it to say that this is a topic worthy of its own book.
