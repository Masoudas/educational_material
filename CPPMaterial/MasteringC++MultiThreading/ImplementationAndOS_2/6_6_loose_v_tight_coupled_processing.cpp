/**
 * A multiprocessing system does not necessarily have to be implemented within a single system, but can also 
 * consist of multiple systems which are connected in a network. Such a cluster is then called a loosely 
 * coupled multiprocessing system. 
 * 
 * This is in contrast with a tightly coupled multiprocessing system, whereby the system is integrated on a 
 * single printed circuit board (PCB), using the same low-level, high-speed bus or similar.
