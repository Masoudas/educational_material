So when we create a static lib, the object files are left as is. In other words, NO LINKAGE takes place during
the generation of static libs. There'd still be unresolved references in the binray.

As opposed to that, with an executable, a linkage takes place, and all references are resolved (I'm guessing
even when we use a shared lib).

A dynamic library however stands between the two. It's almost ready to be executed, but not quite. In fact, in
some operating system like Linux, it can even be executed!
