Here's a though:

Say a dynamic library has a global variable that it uses. What happens during the linkage process to this
global variable?

As the book says, the operating system does not create one variable, to be used by all the processes in the
machine. Therefore, we probably have one copy for each process. But I'm not sure!

The point however (I guess) is that the OS creates a copy of the dynamic library for all processes. Say the
shared lib has a function, we know where the function resides in memory, and where in the memory results will
be written. Therefore, that piece of code can be shared by all the processes running on the machine.
