Well obviously, we can't link an executable to a static or dynamic library. This I think is because an executable
has code that allow it to run, memory usage that is defined, etc.

The reverse however is true, and we can link a static or dynamic library to an executable.

Now, can we link a shared to a static library? Yes. For example, when we write a library, we use many functions,
such as windows functions etc, all of which are dynamic.

Can we link a static to another static library? The answer has to be yes.

Can we link a static to a shared library? Probably yes. The linkage step takes care of resolving problems,
placing code, etc.

Can we link a shared to a shared library? The answer is yes.
