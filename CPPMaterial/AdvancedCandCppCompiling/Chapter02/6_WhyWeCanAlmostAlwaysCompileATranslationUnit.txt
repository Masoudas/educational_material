Now, based on the observations we've had thus far, the only thing we need to ensure when it comes to compiling
source files is that all symbols are defined, together with inclusions (and of course the logic and the
syntax of the code). 

The point is, once we have our machine code (object files), we can actually reuse them in any other project, because
the object file is path and project independent. We can just dump this translation unit into another project, and
just reuse it (of course, assuming the other project has the same compilation mechanism). This all lends to the fact
that the compiler tiles the binary during linkage, and that the address of unknown objects is resolved at runtime.

As we shall discuss, this lead us to the idea of static and dynamic linkage.
