Compiling (from source to object file) can be broken roughly into preprocessing, linguistic analysis,
assembling, optimization, and code emission.

(Me: In Layman's term, source code is preprocessed to create a text that has all symbols defined,
then all the commands are checked for syntax, then the code is turned into assembly language,
then assembly language code is optimized, finally that optimized code is turned into object file, aka,
machine code).
