/**
* As we saw in the interface of ordered STs, we can delete the min and max. Aside from the cost of such ops,
* which we shall discuss, note an important difference between Sts and priority queues. In priority queses,
* we're allowed to have repetitive keys, where as this can't be the case in symbol tables. Hence, an ST is 
* essentially like an indexed PQ (again, with the exception that it can't accept repetitive keys.)
