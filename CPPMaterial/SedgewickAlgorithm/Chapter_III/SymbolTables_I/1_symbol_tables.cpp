/**
* The primary goal of symbol tables is to associate keys with values. The client can insert key-value pairs 
* into the symbol table with the expectation of later being able to search for the value associated with a 
* given key, from among all of the key-value pairs that have been put into the table.
* 
* Definition. A symbol table is a data structure for key-value pairs that supports two operations: 
*	- insert (put) a new pair into the table,
*	- search for (get) the value associated with a given key.
