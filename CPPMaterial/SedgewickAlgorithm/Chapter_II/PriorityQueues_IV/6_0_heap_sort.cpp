/**
* If we use heaps, we'd get a sorting algorithm called heap sort. 
* 
* There are two challenges when sorting using heaps:
* 1-	Creating the heap from the original array.
* 2-	Sorting the array using the heap.
* 
* In what follows, we discuss how to create the heap and sort in place, so that we don't have to use
* extra memory.
