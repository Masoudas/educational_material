The find_program command is used to find a program. The short signature is as follows:
find_program (<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

where VAR holds the path to the program we seek. A cache entry, or a normal variable if NO_CACHE is specified, named by <VAR> is 
created to store the result of this command. If the program is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not 
be repeated unless the variable is cleared. If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>-NOTFOUND.

What do we mean by a program? It appears we mostly mean system binaries, such as sh, etc.

Example:
find_program(BASH_EXECUTABLE NAMES bash REQUIRED)
