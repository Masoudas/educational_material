Note that the path to a non-standard python path can be passed to the module using the variable 'PYTHON_EXECUTABLE' from the command line 
or otherwise by setting it directly:

$ cmake -S. -B. -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/custom/location/python

or custom location:

set(PYTHON_EXECUTABLE "/custom/location")

As such, this module has the following variables:
    -   PYTHONINTERP_FOUND, a Boolean signaling whether the interpreter was found
    -   PYTHON_EXECUTABLE, the path to the executable for the Python interpreter
    -   PYTHON_VERSION_STRING, the full version of the Python interpreter
    -   PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR, the major version of the Python interpreter
    -   PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR, the minor version of the Python interpreter
    -   PYTHON_VERSION_PATCH, the patch number of the Python interpreter
