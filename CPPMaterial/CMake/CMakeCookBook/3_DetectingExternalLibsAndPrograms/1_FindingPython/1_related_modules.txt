So here's the deal. Apparently, in the same manner that OpenCV has a FindOpenCV.cmake file associated with it, cmake provides some predefined
modules that can be used to detect other software packages, in this case python.

In the list of modules (using the --help-module-list) we see there are a couple of such 'Find' modules associated with python. One of them is
called FindPython. So just like we add OpenCV to our current project using find_package, we can do the same with python:

find_package(Python COMPONENTS Interpreter Environment Development) 

Now, the same way as OpenCV, and supposing python is in the standard path, this package will provide us with inclusion path and lib path of
python. Some variables according to the command line documentation are:

    -   Python_FOUND
    -   Python_Interpreter_FOUND
    -   Python_EXECUTABLE
    -   ...
