It's been recommended to use the new FindPython module the purposes discussed. It's shown below. Note that 
according to the docmunetation, we better try and find the Development and Interpreter components together, so 
that there's no mismatch between them (see 3_3).

Also optionally, we enforce the c99 standard.
