Apparently we can customize behavior in two times:
	-	Configuration time
		Using 'execute_process' command, as we have done several times.
	-	Build time
		Using 'add_custom_targets'. (Me: I'm not sure this will be effective only if we run the build command
		using the cmake --build, or in general!)
		Another option is 'add_custom_command' to specify commands that have to be executed to generate files or 
		at specific build events of other targets
