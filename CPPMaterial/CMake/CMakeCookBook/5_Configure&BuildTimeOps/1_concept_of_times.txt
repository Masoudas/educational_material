In CMake, we have the following concept of times:
	-	Configure time
		When CMake runs over our CMakeLists.txt file and processes it.
	-	Generation time
		When CMake generates the native build files, such as Make in Unix, VS project files in Windows, etc.
	-	Build time
		When we build our project using the build files, by running for example the wrapper command. This is the
		point when the compiler will be invoked.

The following times follow as well:
	-	CTest time or test time: When we run the test suite to check whether the targets perform as intended.
	-	CDash time or report time: When the results of testing the project are uploaded to a dashboard to be 
		shared with other developers.
	-	Install-time: When the targets, source files, executables, and libraries are installed from the build 
		directory to an install location.
	-	CPack time or packaging time: When we package our project for distribution, either as source code or 
		binary.
	-	Package install time: When the newly minted package is installed system-wide.
