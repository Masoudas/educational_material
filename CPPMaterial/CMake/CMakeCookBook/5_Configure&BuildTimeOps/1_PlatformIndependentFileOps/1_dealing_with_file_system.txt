When building a target, often we need to check-out for particular files, their existence, creating or executing an
archive, etc. 

With CMake, we are not only able to generate the build system on different platforms, we are also able to perform 
these operations without complicated logic to abstract away the different operating systems.

Next, we shall show how to extract the eigen library, which will then enable us to use the library file and the
header files of it.
