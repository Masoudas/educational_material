So let's say we need to download a package, let's say the source tree of a project and build it from the command
line. Actually, cmake allows us to do so, using an internal cmake module called FetchContent. 

Now, if we get the help for this command, we get:
$ cmake --help-module FetchContent
This module enables populating content at configure time via any method supported by the ``ExternalProject`` module.  
Whereas ``ExternalProject_Add()`` downloads at build time, the ``FetchContent`` module makes content available 
immediately, allowing the configure step to use the content in commands like ``add_subdirectory()``, ``include()`` 
or ``file()`` operations.

Essentially, FetchCommand is like add_module, in the sense that once the thing is downloaded and built, we have
it available as variables in our cmake project.
