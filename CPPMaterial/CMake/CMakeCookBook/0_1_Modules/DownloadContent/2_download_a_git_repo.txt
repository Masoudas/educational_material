Say for example we wanted to download a git repository, like for example catch2 or google test. The command would
then look something like this:

include(FetchContent)	# Well. Apparently this is an inclusion, and not a find_package. It does not have a 
						# .cmake file associated with it.

FetchContent_Declare(
   googletest		# Name this target(ish), which can be used later on for our purposes.
   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
   GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
)

Note that fetching a content does not mean actually building it. To build the content, there's a command, which
we shall discuss next. In reallity, fetching a content does not do anything special, and we indeed have to build
it, as we shall discuss next.

Note that we can do crazier stuff with this command as well, and for example download a set of logos from the
internet:

FetchContent_Declare(
      myCompanyIcons
      URL      https://intranet.mycompany.com/assets/iconset_1.12.tar.gz
      URL_HASH 5588a7b18261c20068beabfb4f530b87
    )
