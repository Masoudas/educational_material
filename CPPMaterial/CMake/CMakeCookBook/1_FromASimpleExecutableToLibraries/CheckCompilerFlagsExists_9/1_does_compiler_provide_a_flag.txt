Sometimes, we don't know wether a compiler provides a certain flag for us. Hence, before applying it and using it to compile the code, we need
to ensure that it actually exists and work, so that we could apply it. 

But apart from the complicated discussions, suppose that we want to check whether our compiler provides certain obvious flags, like "WPedantic"
or "O3" optimization flags. For CXX compilers, the "check_cxx_compiler_flag" is the method we seek:

include(CheckCXXCompilerFlag)   # The module that contains this variable

check_cxx_compiler_flag("-WPedantic" _Has_Pedantic)
check_cxx_compiler_flag("-O3" _Has_O3)
check_cxx_compiler_flag("-march=native" _march_native_works)    # Has native architecture
check_cxx_compiler_flag("-xHost" _xHost_works)
