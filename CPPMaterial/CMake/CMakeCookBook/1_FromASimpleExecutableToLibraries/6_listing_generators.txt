Typing cmake --help lists the generators for cmake:

$ cmake --help

For example on Linux, we have make, as well as for example Ninja.

We can pass new generators to cmake using the -G option.

$ cmake -S. -Bbuild -G Ninja

In this way, we see that the build system generated has the build.ninja and rules.ninja files. Finally, running
the "cmake --build ." wrapps the ninja command in a unified, cross-platform interface.
