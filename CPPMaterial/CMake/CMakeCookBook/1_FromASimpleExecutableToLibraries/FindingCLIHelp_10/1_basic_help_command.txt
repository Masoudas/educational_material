So, if we punch in the following command, we see the basic help results:

$ cmake --help

Notice that the printed info has a couple of sections:
Options
  -S <path-to-source>          = Explicitly specify a source directory.
  -B <path-to-build>           = Explicitly specify a build directory.
  -C <initial-cache>           = Pre-load a script to populate the cache.
  ...
  --help-command <cmd> [<f>]   = Print help for one command and exit.
  --help-command-list [<f>]    = List commands with help available and exit.
  --help-commands [<f>]        = Print cmake-commands manual and exit.
  --help-module <mod> [<f>]    = Print help for one module and exit.
  ...
  Generators

  The following generators are available on this platform (* marks default):

                                   Use -A option to specify architecture.

We can see that in particular, there's command line help provided for various commands, and modules etc. We shall explore each help command
