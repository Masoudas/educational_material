Same as with commands, we can list all the available modules in cmake. Note that these would be the default modules of cmake, not for example 
the OpenCV module which we may have installed:

$ cmake --help-module-list

For example, we can check for "FindPython3" help as follows:

$ cmake --help-module-FindPython3
