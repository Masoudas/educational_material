For each loops can be used in four different forms:

    -   Over explicit elements
We say foreach(arg val1 val2 ...). We then interpolate ${arg}, which would be the value of val1.

    -   Over content of lists:
We say foreach(item IN LISTS list1 list2 ...)

    -   Over an integer range
We say foreach(loop_var RANGE [START] STOP [STEP]), where both start and stop are inclusive.

    -   As a loop over items
foreach(var IN ITEMS ${list1}) is equivalent to for each IN LISTS.
