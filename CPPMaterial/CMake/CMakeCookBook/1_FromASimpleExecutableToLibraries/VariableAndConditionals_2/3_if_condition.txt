The if condition as we may recall had a paranthesis in front of every condition:

if()
else()
endif()

Recall that:
    -   A logical variable is true if it is set to any of the following: 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non-zero number.
    -   A logical variable is false if it is set to any of the following: 
        0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, NOTFOUND, an empty string, or it ends in the suffix -NOTFOUND
        A raw string is false. A variable set to a non-empty string is true.


if("This is false")
endif()

set(var "something")
if(${var} AND var)  # This is true
endif()

Note that if we're dealing with booleans, we can just put then inside the if condition:
option(BoolVar "" TRUE)

if(BoolVar)
    // Do something ...
endif()
