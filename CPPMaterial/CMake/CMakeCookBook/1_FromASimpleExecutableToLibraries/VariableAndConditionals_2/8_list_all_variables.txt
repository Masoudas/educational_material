As variables are properties of CMake (and not a particular Target,) we use the get_cmake_propery to list the name of all variables of CMake.

The documentation specifies:
This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables currently defined. It is intended for debugging purposes.

As such, here's a macro for printing all the variables:

macro(print_vars)
    get_cmake_propery(_varNames VARIABLES)
    foreach(var IN LISTS VARIABLES)
        message(STATUS "Variable ${var} is ${${var}})
    endforeach()
endmacro(print_vars)
