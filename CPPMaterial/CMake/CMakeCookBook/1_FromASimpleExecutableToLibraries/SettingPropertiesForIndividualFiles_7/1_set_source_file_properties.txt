The same way we can set properties for an entire target, we can fine grain the properties for a particular
source file as well. The function for this end is called set_source_file_properties

set_source_file_properties(source_file PROPERTIES prop1 val1 ...)
get_source_file_properties(_property source_file prop ) # Sets the value of the property inside _property

Note: I assume we can activate certain defintions for a particular file as well, using the -D option.
