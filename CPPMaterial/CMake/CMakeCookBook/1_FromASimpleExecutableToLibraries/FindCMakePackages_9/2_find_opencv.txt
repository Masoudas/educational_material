In this example, we try and load the opencv package for our project, and to checkout whether or not it has been done. Note that OpenCV lies
on the c:\opencv-4.5.1 on my current Windows machine, so it's not on the default search path. Hence, I need to explicitly define it.
Notice that the actuall package file is called OpenCVConfig.cmake, but we drop the config part.
