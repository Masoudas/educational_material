Here's the question: What does an included package provide for us? Aside from other possible useful information, a package provides two things
for us:
    -   A library (target) name, which we can link against using target link libraries. This variable is usually called "PACKAGENAME_LIBS"
    -   An inclusion path, which can use with target_include_directories to include against. This variable is usually called
        "PACKAGENAME_INCLUDE_DIRS"

Take for instance our OpenCV. After finding the package, two variables provide these properties for us:
    -   OpenCV_LIBS
    -   OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS

Question is, how can I list these variables, to use them for inclusion and addition? The answer is that we can list all variables as 
discussed in VariablesAndConditionals_2 (using get_cmake_propery method of course.) As such, we can find the name we look for somewhere in 
there.
