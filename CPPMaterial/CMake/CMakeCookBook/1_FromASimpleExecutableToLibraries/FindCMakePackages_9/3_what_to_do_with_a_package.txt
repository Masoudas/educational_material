Here's the question: What does an included package provide for us? Aside from other possible useful information, a package provides two things
for us:
    -   A library (target) name, which we can link against using target link libraries. This variable is usually called 
        "PACKAGENAME_LIBS"
    -   An inclusion path, which can use with target_include_directories to include against. This variable is usually called
        "PACKAGENAME_INCLUDE_DIRS"

Take for instance our OpenCV. After finding the package, two variables provide these properties for us:
    -   OpenCV_LIBS
    -   OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS

Question is, how can I list these variables?
