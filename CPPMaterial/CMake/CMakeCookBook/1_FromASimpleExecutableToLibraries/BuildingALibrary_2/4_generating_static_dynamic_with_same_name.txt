Can we generate the static and dynamic libraries with the same name, and link against the one that we desire?

Yes! A target property called OUTPUT_NAME helps us with that:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
add_library(MSG_LIB_SHARED SHARED Message.hpp Message.cpp)

set_target_properties(MESSAGE_LIB_SHARED
    PROPERTIES
    OUTPUT_NAME MSG_LIB
)
