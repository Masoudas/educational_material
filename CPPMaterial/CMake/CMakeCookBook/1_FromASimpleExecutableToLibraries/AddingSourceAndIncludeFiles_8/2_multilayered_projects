Of course, now we can see how to make targets from multi-layered projects. That is, use these two commands to add files to the 
target, by noting that each subfolder cmake file can be added using either the include or add_subdirectory method.

Note: I need to check this out further, but I save that the path to target sources need to be set ralative to the parent folder inside a 
subfolder, and not from the subfolder itself. Although this can be changed based on the policies I guess.

Imagine:
    -   src -- main.cpp
         |
         - hello  -- hello.cpp      --> target_sources(target src/hello.cpp)
