So imagine a project has multiple sub-folders, and it has respective include subfolders as well. To include each one of them for 
a particular target, we use two functions, one is to add sources to the target, one is to add include directories to the folder:

target_sources(target_name      # Note that the target must have already been made
    PRIVATE     # What is the point of having private here?
        source1.cpp     # If relative path is given, computes from this dir.
        source2.cpp
)

target_include_directories(target_name # To add include directories. Note that as the name suggests, it includes directories, and
                                       # and not particular include files! 
    PRIVATE     # Again, why we need it? 
    dir # If relative path is given, computes from this dir   
)
