Apparently, we can set the compiler for all targets as well as for particular targets. Moreover, the compiler
flags can be set for each configuration (build type) as well.

To set the compiler flags for all targets, use the CMAKE_<Lang>_FLAG_<Config> CMake variables:
    -   CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG
    -   CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE
    -   CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG
    -   CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE
    -   CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS # Common among all compilations

Question: Would the global options be passed together with those defined for local targets? Or will they be
passed together as complements?

Answer: Yes. Flags specified for a particular target override those given by the above global flags.
