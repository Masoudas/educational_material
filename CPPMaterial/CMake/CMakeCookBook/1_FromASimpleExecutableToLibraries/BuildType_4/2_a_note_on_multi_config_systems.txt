In VS or XCode for example, it's possible to have several config modes at the same type in the IDE. To set which build systems
to have, we need to set the CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES variable:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10.0 FATAL_ERROR)
project(myproj)

set(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES Release;Debug CACHE STRING "build types of the project" FORCE)
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release CACHE STRING "The mode the project is built by from command line" FORCE)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 12 2017 Win64" -D CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="Release;Debug"

And then decide which version we want to actually build using the config option (which is the actuall use of the
config option:)

$ cmake --build . --config Release

Also note that it has been suggested that "When developing code with single-configuration generators, create separate 
build directories for the Release and Debug build types, both configuring the same source. With this, you can 
switch between the two without triggering a full reconfiguration and recompilation."
