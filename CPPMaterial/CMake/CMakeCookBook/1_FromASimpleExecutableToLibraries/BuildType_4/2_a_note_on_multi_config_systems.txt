In VS or XCode for example, we can configure several modes as follows:

$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 12 2017 Win64" -D CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="Release;Debug"

And then decide which version we want to actually build using the config option (which is the actuall use of the
config option:)

$ cmake --build . --config Release

Also note that it has been suggested that "When developing code with single-configuration generators, create separate 
build directories for the Release and Debug build types, both configuring the same source. With this, you can 
switch between the two without triggering a full reconfiguration and recompilation."
