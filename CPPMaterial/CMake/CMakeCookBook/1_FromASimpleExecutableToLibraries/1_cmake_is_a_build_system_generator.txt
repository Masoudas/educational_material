One thing I tend to forget about CMake is that CMake (as opposed to make for example) does not actually create
or generate object files, binaries or anything! Rather it generates the build system that can be use to make
those things. Hence, on Windows it would create a VS solution, and on Linux it would create a MakeFile as a
make script, etc.

Hence when we run the make command:
$ cd build
$ cmake ..  # Meaning in source build, and CMakeLists.txt is in the parent folder of build

The build files are generated. However at this point, it's still possible to actually generate the binaries
using the --build option of cmake:

$ cmake -- build .  # Naturlich, build the current folder.

Or, if we're on Linux for example, we can build it using make

$ make all
