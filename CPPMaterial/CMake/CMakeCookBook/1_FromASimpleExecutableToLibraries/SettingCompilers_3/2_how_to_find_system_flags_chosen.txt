The following command dumps the system information inside the file:

$ cmake --system-information information.txt

It's actually a quite interesting file, and has several information, the most important of which are:
    -   CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LOADED: This is set to TRUE if the language, <LANG>, was enabled for the project.
    -   CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID: The compiler identification string, unique to the compiler vendor. This is, for 
        example, GCC for the GNU Compiler Collection, AppleClang for Clang on macOS, and MSVC for Microsoft Visual 
        Studio Compiler. Note, however, that this variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or 
        languages.
    -   CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNU<LANG>: This logical variable is set to TRUE if the compiler for the language <LANG>
        is part of the GNU Compiler Collection. Notice that the <LANG> portion of the variable name follows the GNU 
        convention: it will be CC for the C language, CXX for the C++ language, and G77 for the Fortran language.
    -   CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION: This variable holds a string with the version of the compiler for the given 
        language. The version information is given in the major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]] format. However, as for 
        CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID, this variable is not guaranteed to be defined for all compilers or languages.

Consider then the following snippet, in which we try and set the compiler flag if it has been loaded:
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
