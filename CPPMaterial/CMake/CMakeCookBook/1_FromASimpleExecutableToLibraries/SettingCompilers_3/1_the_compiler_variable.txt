The variable that holds the compiler name is in the flag CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER, where <LANG> is C or CXX.
Hence, we can set both the generator system and the compiler with cmake.

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18.0)
project(ChoosingCompiler LANGUAGES CXX C)   # If languages are specified, must be both, otherwise it's not looked
                                            # for

message(STATUS ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} ${CMAKE_C_COMPILER})   # I always forget the interpolation $!

$ cmake ..
/usr/bin/c++/usr/bin/cc

Notice the two symbolic variables that are printed here. These are the default symbolic links the compilers are
read from.

Naturlich, we can set this flag on the command line:
$ cmake -DCMake_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMake_C_COMPILER=clang

The second option that I see a lot of people use, but actually does not seem to work for me is to export CXX,
CC and FC variables for C++, C and Fortran compilers, respectively, and then run cmake (or make for that
matter.) Again, I checked it, and it doesn't seem to work:

$ env CXX=clang++ cmake ..

Note that all over the Internet, they say that's how to change compiler Make, so I assume they're correct, even
though I've been burnt a couple of times by this.

Evidently, however, we better set options rather than variables, because who knows what the values of another
environment might be.

At configure time, CMake performs a series of platform tests to determine which compilers are available and if 
they are suitable for the project at hand. A suitable compiler is not only determined by the platform we are 
working on, but also by the generator we want to use. The first test CMake performs is based on the name of the 
compiler for the project language. For example, if cc is a working C compiler, then that is what will be used as
the default compiler for a C project. On GNU/Linux, using Unix Makefiles or Ninja, the compilers in the GCC 
family will be most likely chosen by default for C++, C, and Fortran. On Microsoft Windows, the C++ and C 
compilers in Visual Studio will be selected, provided Visual Studio is the generator. MinGW compilers are the 
default if MinGW or MSYS Makefiles were chosen as generators.
