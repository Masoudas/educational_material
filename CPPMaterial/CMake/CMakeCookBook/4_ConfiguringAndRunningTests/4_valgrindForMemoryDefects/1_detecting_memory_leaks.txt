Valgrind is a tool (at least in Linux) to detect memory leaks. As such, we can easily use it as follows:

$ valgrind ./program
...

And the output command shows whether a memory leak has occured or not. An interesting approach to detect if such a leak has occured
automatically without having to manualy check the result is to use grep:

$ valgrind ./program | grep "LEAK_REGEX" --quiet
$ echo $?

Other things valgrind can check is for example reading/writing out of memory bounds.

Valgrind in Windows? It's complex, and requires MinGW.
