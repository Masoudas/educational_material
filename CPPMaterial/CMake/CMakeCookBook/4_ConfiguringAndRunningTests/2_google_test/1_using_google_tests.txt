To use google tests, as we show later on, we shall download the test git repository and then build the targets
from that. This is actually quite cool! To download the content of the repo, we use the FetchContent header of
cmake, which exactly does that.

Now, suppose we have a sum function. Then the tests are written as follows. Notice how similair the tests are
to junit tests, in the sense that they have assert functions.

#include "sum_integers.hpp"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

#include <vector>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}

TEST(example, sum_zero) {
  auto integers = {1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3};
  auto result = sum_integers(integers);
  ASSERT_EQ(result, 0);
}

TEST(example, sum_five) {
  auto integers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  auto result = sum_integers(integers);
  ASSERT_EQ(result, 15);
}
