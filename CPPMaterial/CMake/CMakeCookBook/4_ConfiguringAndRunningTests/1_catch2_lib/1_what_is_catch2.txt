Typically, we want more sophisticated tests where we can see the failure of a particular test, comparison with numerical tolerances,
etc. For this end, we can use the catch2 library (See https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

As the tutorials say, there are essentially two ways to integrate this library in our project:
    -   Download the header and source file, and use them in our project.
    -   Incorporate the project as a CMake module (using find_package)

In the following example set, we use the first method. But keep in mind that this method is slower because the catch library has 
to be compiled. Hence, the CMake version is better.
