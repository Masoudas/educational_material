Notice that a simple run of the tests will run all the tests:

$ ctest
... running all tests

$ ctest -L quick	# Running the set labelled quick
$ ctest -L long 	# Running the set labelled long

$ ctest -I 1,3,4	# Running the tests by index (indexes are the order of definition)

$ ctest -R feature	# Running all tests that have the word feature in them.
