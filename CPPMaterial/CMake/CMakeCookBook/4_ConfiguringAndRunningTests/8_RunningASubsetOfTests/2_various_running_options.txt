Notice that a simple run of the tests will run all the tests:

$ ctest
... running all tests

$ ctest -L quick	# Running the set labelled quick
$ ctest -L long 	# Running the set labelled long

$ ctest -I 1,3,4	# Running the tests by index (indexes are the order of definition.) Note that we have
					# -I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file]. As such, If we wanted to run test 1 and 4
					# only, we'd write -I 0,0,0,1,4

$ ctest -R feature	# Running all tests that have the word feature in them.
