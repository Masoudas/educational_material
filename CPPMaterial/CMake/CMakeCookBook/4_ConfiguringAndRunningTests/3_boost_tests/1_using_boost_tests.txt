Using boost tests is essentially like linking against boost libraries. Therefore, we can use the package (module)
FindBoost to detect our boost libraries, and then work from there.

The only point is the downloading and installation of boos libraries. Notice that the boost libraries must be
installed on the system, and just downloading them is not enough.

Here's a sample boost test for our sum_up library:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#include "sum_integers.hpp"
#include <vector>

#define BOOST_TEST_MODULE example_test_suite
#include <boost/test/unit_test.hpp>

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(add_example) {
	auto integers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	auto result = sum_integers(integers);
	BOOST_REQUIRE(result == 15);
}
