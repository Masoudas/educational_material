Here's a simple example for just determining the platform. Notice that we say the language of the project is
none!

On systems that have the uname command, the CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME is set to the output of uname -s.

To minimize trouble when moving from one platform to another, you should avoid using Shell commands directly 
and also avoid explicit path delimiters (forward slashes on Linux and macOS and backward slashes on Windows). 
Only use forward slashes in CMake code as path delimiters and CMake will automatically translate them for the 
OS environment in question.
