What we normally like to do is to create a configurable header (see section 5,) and then config it using these information. So imagine that 
header is called config.hpp.in, the content of it may look something like this:

#define NUMBER_OF_LOGICAL_CORES @_NUMBER_OF_LOGICAL_CORES@
#define NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES @_NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES@
...

Now, here's the other important part. Once this header is configured, where do we put it? And how do we include it inside the desired target 
include path?
The answer is that where ever we put it, and it should be among the first things we build, the path to it should be declared for the target that
requires it using target_include_directories().

For example, some people choose to configure this header inside the build folder, in which case the inclusion path must be the binary folder.
