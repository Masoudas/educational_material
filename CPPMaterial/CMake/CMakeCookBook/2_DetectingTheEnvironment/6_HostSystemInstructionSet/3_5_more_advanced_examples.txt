For a more fine-grained processor instruction set detection, consider this module: 
https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc/blob/master/cmake/OptimizeForArchitecture.cmake. Sometimes, the host building the code may not be the same as the 
host running the code. This is often the case on compute clusters where the login node architecture may differ from the architecture found on 
compute nodes. One way to solve this is to submit the configuration and compilation as a computation step and deploy it to the compute nodes.
