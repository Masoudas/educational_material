To fill the instruction set variables, we use the cmake_host_system_information function. Imagine we wanted the number of physical cores.
We then write something like:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.0 FATAL_ERROR)
project(info LANGUAGES NONE)

set(n_cores "")
cmake_host_system_information(RESULT n_cores QUERY NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES)    % Again, on my intel processor, half number of logical cores.
message(STATUS ${n_cores})
