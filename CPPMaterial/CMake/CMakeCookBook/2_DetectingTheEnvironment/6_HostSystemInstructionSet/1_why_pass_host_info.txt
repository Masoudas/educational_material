Note that for certain hosts, we want to acquire as many information about the system as possible. Moreover, in the code we usually have a header
file defined with these properties, which we can of course config to ensure that these system instructions are known by the code, which it 
then can use to compile the code. 

These information may include trivial things like available memory, available virtual memory, number of logical and physical cores, etc. 

Thankfully, at least CMake has made these information universal, by providing particular names for them:
    -   NUMBER_OF_LOGICAL_CORES
    -   NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES
    -   TOTAL_VIRTUAL_MEMORY
    -   AVAILABLE_VIRTUAL_MEMORY
    -   TOTAL_PHYSICAL_MEMORY
    -   AVAILABLE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY
    -   IS_64BIT
    -   HAS_FPU
    -   HAS_MMX
    -   HAS_MMX_PLUS
    -   HAS_SSE
    -   HAS_SSE2
    -   HAS_SSE_FP
    -   HAS_SSE_MMX
    -   HAS_AMD_3DNOW
    -   ...
