As always, there's a CMake variable that's used for determining the processor architecture, called CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.
As always, there's a difference between the host system and the target system. CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR variable. Whereas the former 
contains the name of the CPU CMake is currently running on, the latter will contain the name of the CPU we are currently building 
for.

A simple example of a loop that checks for architecture is as follows:
if(CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR MATCHES "i386")
  message(STATUS "i386 architecture detected")
elseif(CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR MATCHES "i686")
  message(STATUS "i686 architecture detected")
elseif(CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR MATCHES "x86_64")
  message(STATUS "x86_64 architecture detected")
elseif(CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR MATCHES "AMD64")
  message(STATUS "AMD64 architecture detected")
else()
  message(STATUS "host processor architecture is unknown")
endif()

There are more approaches here for detecting the processor type. But for now, I shall not go over them.
