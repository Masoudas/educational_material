So now, suppose we want to configure this header file by replacing values. How do we go about that? The answer is that we define
variables inside CMAKE and set them to the values we want. Then, using the configure_file function, CMAKE automatically fills 
those fields for us.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
set(CXX_STANDARD "C++20")
set(USE_GPU "TRUE")
set(NUMBER_OF_LOGICAL_CORES "16")
set(NUMBER_OF_PHYSICAL_CORES "8")

configure_file(config.h.in config.h @ONLY)
