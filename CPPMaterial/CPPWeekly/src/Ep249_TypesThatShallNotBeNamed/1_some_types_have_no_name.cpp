* As we already know, C++ is a strongly typed language. This would imply that everything is typed. However,
* some types have no definitive name, and are only named by compiler.
* 
* An incomplete list of unnamed types is:
* 1-	Lambdas
* 2-	A private nested classes
* 3-	a local class (inside a function, or possibly some other scopes).
