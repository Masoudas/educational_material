/**
* As we already know, we can overload almost all operators in C++. But how we overload them is a more
* interesting question.
* 
* There are three strategies when it comes to overloading an operator for a class?
* 1- Overload the operator inside the class.
* 2- Overload the operator outside the class, as a free function.
* 3- Use a free standing function inside the class.
* 
* Now, each of these have advantages and drawbacks, which we'll discuss in what follows.
