Warn about virtual methods where code quality would be improved if the method were declared with the C++11 
final specifier, or, if possible, its type were declared in an anonymous namespace or with the final specifier. 

This warning is more effective with link time optimization, where the information about the class hierarchy 
graph is more complete. It is recommended to first consider suggestions of -Wsuggest-final-types and then 
rebuild with new annotations.
