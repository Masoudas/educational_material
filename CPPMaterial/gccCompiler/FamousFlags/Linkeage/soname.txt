The -soname option to the linker names the soname of the library.

According to Wikipedia:

In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, a soname is a field of data in a shared object file.[1] The soname is a 
string, which is used as a "logical name" describing the functionality of the object. Typically, that name is 
equal to the filename of the library, or to a prefix thereof, e.g. libc.so.6.

Example:

$ gcc -fPIC -c -Wall -g mod1.c mod2.c mod3.c 	# Create PIC object files.
$ gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libbar.so -o libfoo.so \	# set soname as libbar.
           mod1.o mod2.o mod3.o
