Warn about types with virtual methods where code quality would be improved if the type were declared with the 
C++11 final specifier, or, if possible, declared in an anonymous namespace. 

This allows GCC to more aggressively devirtualize the polymorphic calls. This warning is more effective with 
link time optimization, where the information about the class hierarchy graph is more complete.
