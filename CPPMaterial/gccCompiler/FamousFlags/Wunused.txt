-Wunused A set of four flags warning about various unused things:

    -Wunused-function: Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined or a non-inline static 
        function is unused. This warning is enabled by -Wall.   
    -Wunused-label: Warn whenever a label is declared but not used. This warning is enabled by -Wall.      
    -Wunused-value: Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not used. To suppress this 
        warning cast the unused expression to void. This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand side 
        of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example, an expression such as x[i,j] causes a 
        warning, while x[(void)i,j] does not.      
    -Wunused-variable: Warn whenever a local or static variable is unused aside from its declaration. This 
        option implies -Wunused-const-variable=1 for C, but not for C++. This warning is enabled by -Wall.
