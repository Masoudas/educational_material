    - Wall
This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to 
avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros. This also enables some language
specific warnings described in C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options. 

    - Wextra
This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall. (This option used to be called -W. The 
older name is still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.) 

    - Wpedantic   
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, 
and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C 
standard specified by any -std option used.
