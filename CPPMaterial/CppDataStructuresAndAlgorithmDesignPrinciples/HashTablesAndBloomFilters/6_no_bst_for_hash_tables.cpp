/**
* Even though it's been suggested to use bst for hash table, note that it doesn't make sense to do so. Because
* first off, the purpose of hash tables to allow a finding of O(1), which is O(log(n)) here. Second, if we create
* a bst, then there's no point making a hash! We just use an equality! Unless it's expensive, in which case it's
* logical to use a hash perhaps!
