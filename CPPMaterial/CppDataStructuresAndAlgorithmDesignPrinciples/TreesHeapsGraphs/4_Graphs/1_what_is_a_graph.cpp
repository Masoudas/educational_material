/**
* Loosely speaking, a graph consists of nodes and edges, where an edge reperesents a relationship between the
* nodes. Note that there can be several edges between two nodes of a graph. A node can also be cyclic and 
* have an edge to itself.
* 
* An unweghted graph shows only the connection between nodes of a graph. Lack of an edge implies lack of 
* connection between the nodes.
* A weighted graph conveys additional information between nodes of a graph. 
* 
* We also undirected and directed graphs:
* - Undirected graph: Indicates that edges are bidirectional
* - Directed graph: Indicates that the edges are uni-directional.
