/**
 * A variable that is part of a class, yet is not part of an object of that class, 
 * is called astaticmember. There is exactly one copy of a static member instead 
 * of one copy per object, as for ordinary non-static members.
 * 
 * Similarly,  a function  that  needs  access  to  members  of  a class, 
 * yet doesn’t need to be invoked for a particular object, is called 
 * a static member function.
 * 
 * If a static member is defined, it has to be INITIALIZED for its memory
 * to be accessible elsewhere. Otherwise for example in the below class if we define
 * default_date and don't assign a default to it, we'll get an error. Hence,
 * DEFINITION OF STATIC IS NOT INITIALIZATION. 
 * The definition for a static data member shall appear in a namespace scope 
 * enclosing the member’s class definition (See _2 of here).
 * 
 * We can access a static member or function using the object, or using the scope
 * operator (like Date::set_default). The latter is preferable.
 * 
 * When defining a static member or function outside the class definition, the
 * keyword static should not be repeated.
