/***
 * 
 * Here are a list of rules that are important for writing classes:
 * 
 * 1- Define any constructor explicit, unless you have a good reason not to.
 * 2- Override copy constructor.
 * 3- Override move constructor.
 * 4- For private class members (that are not returned directly to the client of the class), use unique pointers.
