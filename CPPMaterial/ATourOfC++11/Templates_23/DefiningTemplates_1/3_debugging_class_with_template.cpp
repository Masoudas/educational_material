/**
* Bjarne prefers to first define a class with no template argument and debug it. Then, he would
* add the template to see the consequences.
* 
* He also says to better understand what a class does, it's better to consider it with a particular
* type (like char) to see what happens.  This also fits with the philosophy that a generic 
* component should be developed as a generalization of one or more concrete examples, rather than 
* simply being designed from first principles.
