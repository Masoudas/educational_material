* So, we couldn't concretize concepts before C++20, but as of C++20, there's a concepts library and the use of
* the word requires. Essentially, it's going to be about imposing concepts on the types, which is what the big
* guy is going to talk about. 
* 
* The following discussion is important to understand the history, because without the past, we can't navigate
* our way into the future.
