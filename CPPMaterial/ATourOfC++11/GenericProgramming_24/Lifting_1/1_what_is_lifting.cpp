/**
* A function template is a generalization of an ordinary function in the sense that it can perform its actions on 
* a variety of data types and use a variety of operations passed as arguments to implement those actions. An 
* algorithm is a procedure or formula for solving a problem: a finite series of computation steps to produce a 
* result. Thus, a function template is often called an algorithm.
* 
* How do we get from a function doing specific operations on specific data to an algorithm doing more general 
* operations on a variety of data types? The most effective way of getting a good algorithm is to generalize 
* from one – and preferably more – concrete example. Such generalization is called lifting: that is, lifting a 
* general algorithm from specific functions. It is important to go from the concrete to the abstract while 
* maintaining performance and keeping an eye on what is reasonable. Overly clever programmers can generalize to an 
* absurd extent to try to cover every eventuality. Thus, trying to abstract from first principles in the absence of 
* concrete examples typically leads to bloated, hard-to-use code.
