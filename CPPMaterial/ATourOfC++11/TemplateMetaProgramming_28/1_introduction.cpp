/**
* Programming that manipulates program entities, such as classes and functions, is commonly called metaprogramming.
* 
* The big guy finds it useful to think of templates as generators: They're used to generate new functions and classes
* (me: for different template types.) This leads to the notion of template programming as an exercise in writing
* programs that compute at compile time and generate programs. Variations of this idea have been called two-level 
* programming, multilevel programming, generative programming, and – more commonly – template metaprogramming.
* 
* me: Note two terms here,
*	-	generic programming: Use of templates to generate various types (a.k.a, template programming.)
*	-	template metaprogramming: Programming on various entities such as classes, etc.
*	
* Later we shall also distingush between metaprogramming and template metaprogramming.
