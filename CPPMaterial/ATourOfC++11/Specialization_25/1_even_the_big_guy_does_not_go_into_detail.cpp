/**
* The big guy has the following important note for us. He says regarding particular techniques for templates:
* 
* "Many of these techniques are primarily developed for and used by library implementers. Like most programmers, 
* I prefer to forget about the more advanced techniques most of the time. Where I can, I keep my code simple and 
* rely on libraries so that I can benefit from the use of advanced features in the hands of experts in a given 
* application domain."
