/**
* Literals are the tokens of a C++ program that represent constant values embedded in the source code.
*	-	integer literals are decimal, octal, hexadecimal or binary numbers of integer type.
*	-	character literals are individual characters of type:
*		-	char or wchar_t
*		-	char16_t or char32_t (since C++11)
*		-	char8_t (since C++20)
*	-	floating-point literals are values of type float, double, or long double
*	-	string literals are sequences of characters of type
*		-	const char[] or const wchar_t[]
*		-	const char16_t[] or const char32_t[] (since C++11)
*		-	const char8_t[] (since C++20)
*	-	boolean literals are values of type bool, that is true and false
*	-	nullptr is the pointer literal which specifies a null pointer value (since C++11)
*	-	user-defined literals are constant values of user-specified type (since C++11)
