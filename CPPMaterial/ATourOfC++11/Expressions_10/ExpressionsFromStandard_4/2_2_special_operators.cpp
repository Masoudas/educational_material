/**
* There are also some special operators:
* 
*	-	static_cast converts one type to another related type 
*	-	dynamic_cast converts within inheritance hierarchies
*	-	const_cast adds or removes cv qualifiers
*	-	reinterpret_cast converts type to unrelated type
*	-	C-style cast converts one type to another by a mix of static_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast
*	-	new creates objects with dynamic storage duration
*	-	delete destructs objects previously created by the new expression and releases obtained memory area
*	-	sizeof queries the size of a type
*	-	sizeof... queries the size of a parameter pack (since C++11)
*	-	typeid queries the type information of a type
*	-	noexcept checks if an expression can throw an exception (since C++11)
*	-	alignof queries alignment requirements of a type (since C++11)
