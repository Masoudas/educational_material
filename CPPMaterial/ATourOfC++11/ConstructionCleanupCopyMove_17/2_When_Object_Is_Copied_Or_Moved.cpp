/**
* There are five situations in which an object is copied or moved:
* 1-	Initialization: For initialization from the same object.
* 2-	Assignment initialization: When assigning to an uninitialized object for example.
* 3-	As function argument: Obviously.
* 4-	As function return value Obviously.
* 5-	When an exception is thrown: Exceptions are essentially like functions. Hence, when throwing one,
*	a copy takes place.
