/** 
* When it comes to classes, we must distinguish empty and default constructors.
* 
* An empty (argument) constructor when written overrides the default constructor. Now, if we write {}, 
* the empty constructor that we wrote is called. This is completely different from the empty constructor.
* At least one difference is that with default constructor, when writing {}, all parameters are initialized
* with their corresponding default constructors (see 1_).
* 
* The same notion goes for assignment operator and other constructors and operators, so don't confuse them.
