/**
* As we already know, default constructor creates every element with default.
* 
* Copy constructor creates a copy of each class invariant.
* 
* Note that move constructor, moves everything from the move-from class. it's NOT guaranteed that an arbitrary
* operation on the move-from class works properly. However, destructor works properly.
