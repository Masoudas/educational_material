/**
* Imagine three philosophers are sitting around a table, trying to eat Sushi, but each one of them has only
* one chopstick, set in between them. How can the philosophers eat, without tearing each other apart? The 
* chopsticks here are resources, and the philosophers are threads.
* 
* Now, if each philosopher picks one chop stick, and waits for someone else to finish, then perhaps none will
* put a chopstick down. This is called a deadlock. One other hand, each one may race to take someone else's
* chopsticks before they do. This is called a race condition. We shall continue this metaphore later on.
