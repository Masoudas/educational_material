/**
* A real world CPP project has functions and classes to provide sufficient granularity.
* Then, there's libraries, source files and translation units.
* 
* CPP does not provide a specific language notion for modularity. Instead, it provides several
* features such as functions, classes, and namespaces, and source code organization for that end.
