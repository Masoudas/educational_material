/** This is me:
* As we may already recall, overloading is not resolved among different namespaces. In other words, if
* two namespaces have the same function name, there's no overloading among the two namespaces.
* 
* Moreover, because a new declaration hides previous declarations, a new function that is defined in
* the namespace hides all functions of the same name. Note however that we could remedy this with the
* using declarative.
