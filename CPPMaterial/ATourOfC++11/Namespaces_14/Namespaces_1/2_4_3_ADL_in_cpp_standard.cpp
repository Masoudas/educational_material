/**
* The rules for ADL are phrased in terms of associated namespaces
* 
* -	 If an argument is a class member, the associated namespaces are the class itself (including
* its base classes) and the class’s enclosing namespaces.
* 
* -	 If an argument is a member of a namespace, the associated namespaces are the enclosing
*	namespaces
* 
* -	 Built-in types have no associated namespace.
* 
* We have seen the manifestation of these in the previous examples.
