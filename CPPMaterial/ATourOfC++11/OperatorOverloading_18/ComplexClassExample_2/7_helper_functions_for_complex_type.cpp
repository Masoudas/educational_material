/**
* Well, as is always the case, we essentially need to provide helper functions for our types. Often, this is the ostream's
* operator << for converting the class to an stream. For the case of the complex function for example, there functions
* like abs, acos, cos, etc. 
* 
* Again, if these operators need to get friendly, we can define them as friend operators inside the class, or define them
* as stand-alone functions.
