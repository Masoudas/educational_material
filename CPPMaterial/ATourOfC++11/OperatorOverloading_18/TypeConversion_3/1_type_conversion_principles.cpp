/**
* Fundamentally, we can convert two types to each other in two different ways:
* 1- Using constructors
* 2- Using conversion operators
* 
* In both cases, the conversion can be:
* 1- explicit; that is, the conversion is only performed in a direct initialization, i.e., as an initializer not using a =
* 2- Implicit; that is, it will be applied wherever it can be used unambiguously (§18.4.3), e.g., as a function argument.
