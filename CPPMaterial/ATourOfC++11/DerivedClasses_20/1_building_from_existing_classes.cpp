/**
* The language features support building new classes from existing ones:
*	- Implementation inheritance: to save implementation effort by sharing facilities provided by a base class
*	- Interface inheritance: to allow different derived classes to be used interchangeably through the interface 
*	provided by a common base class.
* 
* Interface inheritance is often referred to as run-time polymorphism (or dynamic polymorphism). In contrast, the  
* uniform use of classes not related by inheritance provided by templates is often referred to as compile-time  
* polymorphism (or static polymorphism).
