* Bjarne says "Some C++ novices get irritated by the ambiguity errors reported by the compiler. 
* More experienced programmers appreciate these error messages as useful indicators of design errors."

* We can specify our intent of which function to call by performing an static_cast. Bjarne believes
* this is not a good idea. "Soon another similar call will be made and
* have to be dealt with."
* 
* Adding an inline method is another way of dealing with the situation.
