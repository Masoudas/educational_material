/** This is all me:
* Decltype has many very interesting uses. Most importantly, as said in the standard, we can use it to create
* instances of class whose constructors we're not aware of, particularly to extract some type. 
* 
* A very interesting example that brought me to this piece of the standard is given in chapter 28, section 4
* on enable_if definitions, and then can_we_call_f_if_x_is_X.
