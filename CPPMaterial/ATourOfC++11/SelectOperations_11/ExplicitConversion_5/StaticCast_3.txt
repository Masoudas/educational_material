Static cast is a compile time caster!
Static cast basically checks for compile time errors, as opposed to a C-Style cast (like 
(int*)), which has no check.

Formally, converts between related types such as one pointer type to another in the same
class hierarchy, an integral type to an enumeration, or a floating-point type to an integral
type. It also does conversions defined by constructors (16.2.6, 18.3.3, iso.5.2.9) and
conversion operators

For example, 
int a = 10;
char c = 'c';

int* p = (int*)&c;	// This may pass compile-time checks;
int* p1 = static_cast<int*>(c);	// This will however throw compile-time errors.

Consider this example:
#include <iostream> 
#include <string> 
using namespace std; 
class Int { 
    int x; 
  
public: 
    Int(int x_in = 0) 
        : x{ x_in } 
    { 
        cout << "Conversion Ctor called" << endl; 
    } 
    operator string() 
    { 
        cout << "Conversion Operator" << endl; 
        return to_string(x); 
    } 
}; 
int main() 
{ 
    Int obj(3); 
    string str = obj; 
    obj = 20; 
    string str2 = static_cast<string>(obj); 
    obj = static_cast<Int>(30); 
    return 0; 
} 

In main:
	1- The first line calls the constructor.
	2- The second line calls the converter operator.
	3- The third line calls the implicit  constructor,
	4- Fourth line calls the converter operator.
	5- The fifth line calls the constructor (what if it were explicit? Even then, there's no problem!!!)

Also, consider the following program:
using namespace std; 
class Base { 
}; 
class Derived : public Base { 
}; 
int main() 
{ 
    Derived d1; 
    Base* b1 = (Base*)(&d1); // allowed 
    Base* b2 = static_cast<Base*>(&d1); 
  
    return 0; 
} 

Both of the above cases are correct, and we have a pointer to base.

However, with this example where inheritance is private (hence, we don't have access to base reference)
only the static_cast method throws an exception.
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class Base { 
}; 
class Derived : private Base { // Inherited private/protected not public 
}; 
int main() 
{ 
    Derived d1; 
    Base* b1 = (Base*)(&d1); // allowed 
    Base* b2 = static_cast<Base*>(&d1); 
    return 0; 
}
