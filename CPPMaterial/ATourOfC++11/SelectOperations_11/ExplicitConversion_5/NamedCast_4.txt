/**
* By named casts we mean cast using const_cast, static_cast, reinterpret_cast and dynamic cast.
* Named casts (using operators such as reinterpret_cast, const_cast, etc ..) are strictly in the hands of the 
* programmer. Hence, they shall be avoided in unnecessary conditions.


* For example:

* Device_addr* addr = reinterpret_cast<Device_addr*>(0xff);

* This implies that the device information is at this position  of the memory?

* Named cast are sometimes necessary, if the type is unknown to the compiler. For example, when malloc
* returns a void pointer, it has to be casted to the proper type it represents.This can be done
* using static_cast.
