/**
 * By qualified initializer list, we mean a list where type is written before the list (T{}).
 * 
 * The basic idea of using initializer list, is to initialize an object using a list expression,
 * either with or without new. The rules constructing an object using a qualified list are
 * those of direct initialization
 * 
 * int t = int{7};
 * Struct s = new Struct{4,5};    // Initialize Struct with the given values.
 * 
 * As we already one, one other way of looking at the qualifed initilizer list is a convertor from
 * one type to another.

 * By an unqualified initializer list, we mean an initializer that does not have a type attached to it.
 * We can use this format when there's no ambiguity.
 * 
 * We can use it as:
 * 1- Function argument.
 * 2- Return value
 * 3- Right hand side of an assignemnt operator like +=, -=, *=
 * 4- A subscript!
