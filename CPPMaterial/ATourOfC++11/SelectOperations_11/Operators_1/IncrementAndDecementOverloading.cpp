/**
 * As we know, ++x takes no ints (per se), whereas x++ is x = x + 1;
 * 
 * So in a class, we can overload prefix increment by writing operator++() and postfix increment by
 * writing operator++(int); The int inside is just for distinguishing the two operators.
 * 
 * In a non-member function, because we need to indicate with the pre and post increment are working on,
 * we ask for a reference to the type they'are working on. We ask for a reference because we want to change
 * the value of the underlying type. Naturally there's no return here.
 * See the examples below. 
 * 
 * If we decide to return with the increment or decrement operator, then we can write expressions like 
 * d = ++c; We usually prefer to overload it with a return type. 
 * If we decide to return, as we discussed in the introduction to increment and decrement, we need to 
 * return a temp object for post increment and decrement. This would imply that we have to make
 * a copy of the object.  But then the question  is, who's going to manage the memory of that object?
 * Well, if the resources are a simple integer, there's no need. Otherwise, the answer is not trivial :D
 * As of now, the following gives me an error saying I'm returning a temporary.
 *
