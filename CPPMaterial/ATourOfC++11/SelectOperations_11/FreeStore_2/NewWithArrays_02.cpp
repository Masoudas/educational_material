/**
 * With arrays, the new operator still returns a pointer, but to the reduced pointer
 * (for example, new int[] is pointer to int, new int[][] is pointer to array). As we already
 * know, this form does not initialize the memory (i.e, everything will be random)
 * 
 * 
 * Can we initialize arrays at the same time we're allocating them on memory?
 * Yes we can. The syntax is T[]{}, where number of elements has to be specified.
 * 
 * For user defined types on the other hand, note that an object (of a class) can never be in an undefined
 * state. It has to always be initialized. Hence, when creating an array, we MUST define a default
 * empty constructor so that it's called by new operator (so that the space it allocates is initialized),
 * like class A below. Otherwise with class B, because it has no such constructor, initialization is impossible.
 * 
 * The problem here is that if base class is abstract, what can we do? Hence, don't use new and array as
 * Bjarne himself says. Use array class.
