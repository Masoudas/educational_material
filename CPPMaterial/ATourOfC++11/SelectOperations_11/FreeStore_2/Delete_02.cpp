void sloppy() // very bad code

/**
 * To overcome this issue, 
 * 1- prefer scoped variables over heap variables as much as possible. Moreover,
 * 
 * 2- Use memory handler objects such as shared_ptr, unique_ptr, weak_ptr;
 * Also, using move semantics can take of this problem as well. Because if we're initializing a new 
 * reference, we want to just move the object, and steal the resources of the first one.
 * 
 * The latter is the RAII principle, better known as resource allocation is initialization.
 * 
 * Here's another interesting way to look at this. We can express with we intend to with resources as follows:
 * 
 * Local objects. The C++ runtime as the owner automatically manages the lifetime of these resources. The same holds for global objects or members of a class. The guidelines calls them scoped objects.
 * References: I'm not the owner. I only borrowed the resource that cannot be empty.
 * Raw pointers: I'm not the owner. I only borrowed the resource that can be can be empty. I must not delete the resource.
 * std::unique_ptr: I'm the exclusive owner of the resource. I may explicitly release the resource.
 * std::shared_ptr: I share the resource with other shared ptr. I may explicitly release my shared ownership.
 * std::weak_ptr: I'm not the owner of the resource but I may become temporary the shared owner of the resource by using the method std::weak_ptr::lock.
