A question that may arise is, how can I get only the version history of a repo, without actually downloading the entire repo.

The answer is use the "--bare" option when cloning
$ git clone --bare source

This way, for example, we can access the log info of the repo. Note this still has to resolve objects, hence it
will use a lot of traffic. It does not, however, copy the project files.
