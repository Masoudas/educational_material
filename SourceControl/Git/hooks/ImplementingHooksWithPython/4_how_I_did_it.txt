Essentially, I added the file to my .git/hooks folder, with the moment when I wanted the hook to execute. For example, I wanted to print hello world after commit, so I did as follows (note that I could have written a bash script as well):

$ cd .git/hooks
$ touch post-commit
$ chmod +x post-commit  # To make it executable.
$ vim post-commit

#!/usr/bin/python

import argparse

def parse_args():
  pass

def main(args=None):
  print("Hello world")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  args = parse_args()
  main(args)
