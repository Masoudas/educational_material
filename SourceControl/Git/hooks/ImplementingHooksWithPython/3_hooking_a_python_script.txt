The default templates directory contains some examples. Each example script ends with the *.example extension. If you remove the extension they become executable git hooks.

Since we are developing using Python lets create a new templates folder. Copy the templates into the python-templates folder.

Erase the contents of the hooks folder, use the gist in this folder (under hook-gist) and extract it into the empty hooks folder.
