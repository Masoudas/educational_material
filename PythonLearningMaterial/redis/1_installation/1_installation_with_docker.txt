Apparently, the best way to run the thing is to create using a Dockerfile. Then, we run the thing using the run command below. The whole purpose of this config is to copy the conf file when running the instance.

NOTE: Of course, we have the choice to choose between a docker network, or exposing the port.

There are several different persistence strategies to choose from. This one will save a snapshot of the DB every 60 seconds if at least 1 write operation was performed (it will also lead to more logs, so the loglevel option may be desirable). If persistence is enabled.
