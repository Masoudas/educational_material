A hash is a mapping of string:string, called field-value pairs, that sits under one top-level key:

ME: Note that it's 'HSET key hash-key value'. We also get 'HGET key hash-key'

127.0.0.1:6379> HSET realpython url "https://realpython.com/"
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> HSET realpython github realpython
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> HSET realpython fullname "Real Python"
(integer) 1

This sets three field-value pairs for one key, "realpython". If you’re used to Python’s terminology and objects, this can be confusing. A Redis hash is roughly analogous to a Python dict that is nested one level deep:

data = {
    "realpython": {
        "url": "https://realpython.com/",
        "github": "realpython",
        "fullname": "Real Python",
    }
}
Redis’ fields are akin to the Python keys of each nested key-value pair in the inner dictionary above. Redis reserves the term key for the top-level database key that holds the hash structure itself.
