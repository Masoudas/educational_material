Just like, there's also hmset and hmget, as the following example demonstrates (ME: We need to repeat the parent key everytime). 

ME: With HMSET we have '$HMSET k1 k11 v1 k12 v2 k13 v3'

$ HMSET pypa url "https://www.pypa.io/" github pypa fullname "Python Packaging Authority"
OK

There's also the 'HGETALL' command. This command shows all the key value pairs, where key is the odd number, and value is the even number:
$ HGETALL pypa
1) "url"
2) "https://www.pypa.io/"
3) "github"
4) "pypa"
5) "fullname"
6) "Python Packaging Authority"
