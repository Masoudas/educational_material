We may use redis and think of it as if it's a python dictionary. Note that these are all string:string mappings.

127.0.0.1:6379> SET Bahamas Nassau
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> SET Croatia Zagreb
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> GET Croatia
"Zagreb"
127.0.0.1:6379> GET Japan
(nil)

We may also set multiple values:
127.0.0.1:6379> MSET Lebanon Beirut Norway Oslo France Paris
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> MGET Lebanon Norway Bahamas
1) "Beirut"
2) "Oslo"
3) "Nassau"

The exists keyword is used for checking if something exists:
127.0.0.1:6379> EXISTS Norway
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> EXISTS Sweden
(integer) 0
