"""
As another example, consider the following sequence creations:

a = range(5) # Method 1, and returns a lazy iterator.

def infinite_loop():
    ctr = 0
    while True:
        yield ctr
        ctr += 1

Note that instead of using a for loop, you can also call next() on the generator object directly.

print(next(infinite_loop());
print(next(infinite_loop()); 

Notice that as such, the function keeps the state up until the execution of yield.

Note that in practice, youâ€™re unlikely to write your own infinite sequence generator. The itertools module 
provides a very efficient infinite sequence generator with itertools.count().
