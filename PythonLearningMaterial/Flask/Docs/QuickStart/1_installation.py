Note that the installation is as simple as:
$ pip install flask

The following packages are installed with flask:
	-	Werkzeug: implements WSGI, the standard Python interface between applications and servers.
	-	Jinja: is a template language that renders the pages your application serves.
	-	MarkupSafe: comes with Jinja. It escapes untrusted input when rendering templates to avoid injection 
		attacks.
	-	ItsDangerous: securely signs data to ensure its integrity. This is used to protect Flaskâ€™s session cookie.
	-	Click is a framework for writing command line applications. It provides the flask command and allows 
		adding custom management commands.

	-	Blinker: provides support for Signals.
	-	python-dotenv: enables support for Environment Variables From dotenv when running flask commands.
	-	Watchdog: provides a faster, more efficient reloader for the development server.
