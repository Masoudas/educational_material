This version of the program modifies the previous one to use Python async features. It also imports the aiohttp module, which is a library to make HTTP requests in an asynchronous fashion using asyncio.

The tasks here have been modified to remove the yield call since the code to make the HTTP GET call is no longer blocking. It also performs a context switch back to the event loop.
