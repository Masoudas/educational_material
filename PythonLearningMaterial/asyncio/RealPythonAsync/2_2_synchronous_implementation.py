How would you create a parent program to do the above tasks in a completely synchronous manner? Since watching the kids is a high-priority task, perhaps your program would do just that. The parent watches over the kids while waiting for something to happen that might need their attention. However, nothing else (like the checkbook or laundry) would get done in this scenario.

Now, you can re-prioritize the tasks any way you want, but only one of them would happen at any given time. This is the result of a synchronous, step-by-step approach. Like the synchronous web server described above, this would work, but it might not be the best way to live. The parent wouldnâ€™t be able to complete any other tasks until the kids fell asleep. All other tasks would happen afterward, well into the night. (A couple of weeks of this and many real parents might jump out the window!)
