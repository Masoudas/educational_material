"""
You can declare multiple Form parameters in a path operation, but you can't also declare Body fields that you expect to receive as JSON, as the request will have the body encoded using application/x-www-form-urlencoded instead of application/json.

This is not a limitation of FastAPI, it's part of the HTTP protocol.
