"""
We can change the port by supplying the port number:

$ python3 manage.py runserver 8080

We may also supply an ip address as follows:

$ python3 manage.py runserver 0:8080    # Or 0.0.0.0:8080

The development server automatically reloads Python code for each request as needed. You don’t need to restart the server for code changes to take effect. However, some actions like adding files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.
