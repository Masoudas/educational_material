"""
You’ll have to take care of some initial setup. Namely, you’ll need to auto-generate some code that establishes a Django project – a collection of settings for an instance of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and application-specific settings.

From the command line, cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, then run the following command:

$ django-admin startproject mysite

Where should this code live?

    You’re probably used to putting code under the web server’s document root (in a place such as /var/www). With Django, you don’t do that. It’s not a good idea to put any of this Python code within your web server’s document root, because it risks the possibility that people may be able to view your code over the web. That’s not good for security.

    Put your code in some directory outside of the document root, such as /home/mycode.
