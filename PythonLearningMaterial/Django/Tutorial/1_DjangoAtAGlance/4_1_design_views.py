"""
Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: Returning an HttpResponse object containing the content for the requested page, or raising an exception such as Http404. The rest is up to you.

Generally, a view retrieves data according to the parameters, loads a template and renders the template with the retrieved data. Hereâ€™s an example view for year_archive from above.

The code shown below loads the news/year_archive.html template.
