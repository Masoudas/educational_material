"""
To use Poetry in your command line, you should install it system-wide. If you just want to try it out, then you can install it into a virtual environment using pip. But you should try this method with caution because Poetry will install its own dependencies, which can conflict with other packages you're using in your project.

The recommended way to install Poetry is by using the official install-poetry script. It's done by checking the website of it.

To get started you need Poetry's bin directory ($HOME/.poetry/bin) in your `PATH` environment variable. Next time you log in this will be done automatically.

To configure your current shell run `source $HOME/.poetry/env`
