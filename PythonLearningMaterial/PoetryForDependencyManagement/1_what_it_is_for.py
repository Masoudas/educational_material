"""
When your Python project relies on external packages, you need to make sure you’re using the right version of each package. After an update, a package might not work as it did before the update. A dependency manager like Python Poetry helps you specify, install, and resolve external packages in your projects. This way, you can be sure that you always work with the right dependency version on every machine.

Using Poetry will help you start new projects, maintain existing ones, and master dependency management. You’ll be prepared to work with pyproject.toml files, which will be the standard for defining build requirements in Python projects.
