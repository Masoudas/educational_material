To add the virtual env to this project, the best way right now it to define its path in 

"python.venvPath"

vs code settings. To get the path to the environment, recall that we can use:

$ poetry env list --full-path


In case we decide to define the env in our current project folder, use:
$ poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
