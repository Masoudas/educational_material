It is clear that the goal of every marketing effort is to generate and grow more revenue for the company. No company wants to spend 
more money on marketing than it generates. In order to correctly report the sales revenue, you will need to clearly define how you 
want to attribute sales to each of your marketing efforts. Some sales might come from email marketing campaigns, while some others 
might come from advertisements placed on TV or public transportation. Some sales could even come naturally, without any attributions 
to any of your marketing campaigns. 

In order to correctly report how much sales revenue each of your marketing efforts drives, you will have to clearly define the rules 
to attribute your sales to each of your marketing efforts. For example, if you are an ecommerce company and promoting special offers 
through email and TV marketing campaigns, you might want to put a different URL in the emails than the URL in your TV commercials. 
This way, you can identify and differentiate those sales from email marketing campaigns from those sales from marketing efforts 
through TV.

Depending on your needs, you might also want to report time-series sales revenue data. You can report it in a spreadsheet format
