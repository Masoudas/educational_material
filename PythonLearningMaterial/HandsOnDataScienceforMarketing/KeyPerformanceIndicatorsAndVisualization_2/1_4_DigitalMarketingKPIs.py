As the choices of marketing channels grow into online space, such as on social network services, blogs, and search engines, 
reporting the performances of digital marketing efforts has become more and more important. Previously discussed KPIs, sales 
revenue, and cost per acquisition, apply in the digital marketing space as well.

As an example, based on individual attribution logic, you can analyze how much sales are generated through different social network 
services, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. You can also analyze how many customers are acquired through such marketing 
channels and see what individual digital marketing campaigns' CPAs and generated values are. 

Click-through rate (CTR) is another KPI that is commonly looked at for digital marketing efforts. CTR is the percentage of people 
who viewed your advertisement and then went on to click the advertisement. The formula looks as follows:
CTR = number of people who clicked / number of people who viewed

Then, you can use lead ratio to measure how much of the website traffic can be converted into leads. Typically, only a subset of 
website traffic is a good fit to become your customers. These marketing qualified leads (MQL) are the leads that are ready to be 
marketed to and meet business-specific criteria to become customers who are likely to make purchases, based on their 
characteristics. As you start marketing to these qualified leads, you should also look at conversion rates. 

The conversion rate is the percentage of leads that are converted into active customers. You can define what should be considered 
as conversions, based on your marketing goals. If your goal is to see what percentage of leads became paying customers, then you 
can compute the conversion rate somewhat similar to the following formula:

Conversion rate = number of paying customers / number of leads
