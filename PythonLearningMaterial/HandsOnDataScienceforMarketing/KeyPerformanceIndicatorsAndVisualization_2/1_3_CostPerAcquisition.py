Another way to look at the effectiveness of your marketing efforts is CPA. This KPI metric tells you how much it costs you to 
acquire a customer through your marketing efforts. A high CPA means it costs more to acquire a new customer, while a low CPA 
clearly means it costs less to acquire a new customer. Depending on the type of business, you can still have a very profitable 
marketing campaign with high CPA. For example, if you are selling a very luxurious and high-end product, where the pool of 
targeted customers is small and it costs more to acquire such customers, your CPA might be high, but the value of each customer 
you acquired might be even higher and result in a profitable marketing campaign.

We will take a look at the following hypothetical case:
######################
Campaign          cost       customers acquired      CPA       sales       sales per customer    value of campaign
Happy Hour       $25,000           40                $625      $50,000            $1,250               $25,000
Webinar          $2,000            10                $200      $5,000             $500                 $3,000
Radio Commercial $7,000            50                $140      $6,000             $120                -$1,000   
######################

If you look at this spreadsheet, Happy Hour Event was the most expensive marketing event, in terms of both the total cost and CPA. 
However, it generated the most Sales and Sales per Customer; thus, it was the most valuable campaign. On the other hand, Radio 
Commercial was the lowest CPA marketing campaign, even though the total cost is the second highest, because it helped the business 
to acquire the most number of customers. However, the total sales from these customers did not exceed the total cost of this 
campaign and introduced a net loss to the company.
