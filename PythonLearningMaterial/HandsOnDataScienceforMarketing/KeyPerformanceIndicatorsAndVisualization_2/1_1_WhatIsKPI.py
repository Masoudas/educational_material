Typically, we want to investigage how well or terrible some of the products are doing. we are going to discuss commonly used key 
performance indicators (KPIs) that help you track the performances of your marketing efforts. More specifically, we will cover 
such KPIs as sales revenue, cost per acquisition (CPA), digital marketing KPIs, and site traffic.

Every marketing effort costs money to the company. When you run marketing campaigns through emails, sending each email costs some 
money. When you are running marketing efforts on social network services or broadcast media, it also requires some capital.
As every marketing effort is associated with some costs, it is critical to look at the performances of marketing campaigns and 
track the return on investments (ROI) of your marketing campaigns. We will mainly discuss how to track sales revenue, CPA, and 
digital marketing KPIs.
