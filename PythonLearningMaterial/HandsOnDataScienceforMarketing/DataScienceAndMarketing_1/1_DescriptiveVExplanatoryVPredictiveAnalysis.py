Descriptive analysis: This is conducted to understand and describe the given dataset better. The purpose of this analysis is 
to quantitatively and statistically summarize the information that the data contains. For example, if you are conducting a 
descriptive analysis on user purchase history data, you will be answering such questions as What is the best selling item? 
What were the monthly sales like in the past year? What is the average price of the items that are sold? Throughout this book, 
we will be conducting descriptive analysis, whenever we introduce a new dataset. 

Explanatory analysis: When the purpose of descriptive analysis is to answer the what and how from the data, explanatory analysis 
is to answer why using the data. This type of analysis is typically conducted when you have a specific question that you want to 
answer. As an example for e-commerce businesses, if you want to analyze what drives your users to make purchases, you would conduct 
explanatory analysis, not descriptive analysis. 

Predictive analysis: This analysis is conducted when there is a specific future event that you would like to predict. The purpose 
of this analysis is to build machine learning models that learn from the historical data and make predictions about events that 
will happen in the future. Similar to the previous examples of e-commerce and purchase history data, one of the questions you can 
answer from this type of analysis may be, Which user is the most likely to make a purchase within the next seven days? Typically, 
in order to conduct predictive analysis, you will have to first run descriptive and explanatory analyses to have a better 
understanding of the data and generate ideas on what types of learning algorithms and approaches to use for the given project.
