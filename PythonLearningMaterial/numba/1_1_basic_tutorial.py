Numba also has wheels available:
$ pip install numba

    Will Numba work for my code?
This depends on what your code looks like, if your code is numerically orientated (does a lot of math), uses NumPy a lot and/or has a lot of loops, then Numba is often a good choice. In these examples we'll apply the most fundamental of Numba's JIT decorators, @jit, to try and speed up some functions to demonstrate what works well and what does not.

Numba works well on code that looks like this:

from numba import jit
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(100).reshape(10, 10)

@jit(nopython=True) # Set "nopython" mode for best performance, equivalent to @njit
def go_fast(a): # Function is compiled to machine code when called the first time
    trace = 0.0
    for i in range(a.shape[0]):   # Numba likes loops
        trace += np.tanh(a[i, i]) # Numba likes NumPy functions
    return a + trace              # Numba likes NumPy broadcasting

print(go_fast(x))

It wonâ€™t work very well, if at all, on code that looks like this:

from numba import jit
import pandas as pd

x = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [20, 30, 40]}

@jit
def use_pandas(a): # Function will not benefit from Numba jit
    df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(a) # Numba doesn't know about pd.DataFrame
    df += 1                        # Numba doesn't understand what this is
    return df.cov()                # or this!

print(use_pandas(x))
