"""
With Bokehâ€™s themes, you can quickly change the appearance of your plot. Themes are a set of pre-defined design parameters such as colors, fonts, or line styles.

Bokeh comes with five built-in themes: caliber, dark_minimal, light_minimal, night_sky, and contrast. Additionally, you can define your own custom themes.

To use one of the built-in themes, assign the name of the theme you want to use to the theme property of your document. (Me: As such, we see that curdoc from bokeh.io is responsible for defining new fields in the document. Perhaps, to define for example right to left labels, I need to use this.)
