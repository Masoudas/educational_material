Library Installation
$ pip install aiohttp

You may want to install optional cchardet library as faster replacement for charset-normalizer:
$ pip install cchardet

For speeding up DNS resolving by client API you may install aiodns as well. This option is highly recommended:
$ pip install aiodns

Installing speedups altogether
The following will get you aiohttp along with charset-normalizer, aiodns and Brotli in one bundle. No need to type separate commands anymore!
$ pip install aiohttp[speedups]
