"""
As stated in the DataModel section of the standard, under dictionaries "Dictionaries preserve insertion order, 
meaning that keys will be produced in the same order they were added sequentially over the dictionary. Replacing 
an existing key does not change the order, however removing a key and re-inserting it will add it to the end instead 
of keeping its old place.

This feature apparently has started from Python 3.7
