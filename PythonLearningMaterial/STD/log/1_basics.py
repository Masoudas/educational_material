"""
The source code is at Lib/logging/__init__.py (in my case, at /usr/lib/python3.8/logging)

The basic classes defined by the module, together with their functions, are listed below.
	-	Loggers expose the interface that application code directly uses.
	-	Handlers send the log records (created by loggers) to the appropriate destination.
	-	Filters provide a finer grained facility for determining which log records to output.
	-	Formatters specify the layout of log records in the final output.
