The class diagram is a central modeling technique that runs through nearly all object-oriented methods. This diagram describes the types of objects in the system and various kinds of static relationships which exist between them.

-   Relationships
There are three principal kinds of relationships which are important:

    *   Association - represent relationships between instances of types (a person works for a company, a company has a number of offices.
    *   Inheritance - the most obvious addition to ER diagrams for use in OO. It has an immediate correspondence to inheritance in OO design.
    *   Aggregation - Aggregation, a form of object composition in object-oriented design.

This can be seen in this figure.

Notice that cardinality is shown in the end. For example, a customer has many orders. An order however belongs to only one customer.
