Because many people are interested in various aspects of UML, different diagrams exist. 
We have two different sorts of diagram:
    -   Structrued diagrams:
    Structure diagrams show the static structure of the system and its parts on different abstraction and implementation levels and how they are related to each other. The elements in a structure diagram represent the meaningful concepts of a system, and may include abstract, real world and implementation concepts, there are seven types of structure diagram as follows:
        
        *   Class Diagram
        *   Component Diagram
        *   Deployment Diagram
        *   Object Diagram
        *   Package Diagram
        *   Composite Structure Diagram
        *   Profile Diagram

    -   Behavioral diagrams:
    Behavior diagrams show the dynamic behavior of the objects in a system, which can be described as a series of changes to the system over time, there are seven types of behavior diagrams as follows:

        *   Use Case Diagram
        *   Activity Diagram
        *   State Machine Diagram
        *   Sequence Diagram
        *   Communication Diagram
        *   Interaction Overview Diagram
        *   Timing Diagram
