To use a private docker registery, one needs to login into the private docker registery. To that end, we need to simply login.

$ docker login private.docker.io username password

Now, once we're logged in, then our credntials are stored inside docker. As such, in docker compose, we simply tell the name of the images in our private image registery. We never have to register again anywhere.
