/**
 * Note that from what I understand, creating the following GUI material (slider, button, etc) is not dependent
 * on the backend package we use (Qt, OpenGl, etc.) These are guaranteed functionalities provided by all the 
 * packages from what I understand.
 * 
 * However, some functionalities appear once we install a particular package. For example, we can create a button
 * once we have Qt backend.
