/**
 * OpenCV provides the following set of GUI libraries for us:
 *      -   The OpenCV basic user interface
 *      -   The OpenCV Qt interface (more advanced)
 *      -   An advanced user interface â€“ OpenGL
 * 
 * Note that by default:
 *      -   A basic interface based on native user interfaces, cocoa or carbon for Mac OS X, and GTK for Linux 
 *          or Windows user interfaces, selected by default when compiling OpenCV.    
 *      -   A slightly more advanced interface based on Qt library that is a cross-platform interface. You have 
 *          to enable the Qt option manually in CMake before compiling OpenCV.
