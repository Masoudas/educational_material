/**
 * Suppose we want to draw the graph of y = f(x). There's no function that can be used to directly draw
 * this graph for us. However, we can use the line function to draw the various segments of this line.
 * 
 * Hence, for example, if wanted to draw the histogram of an image as a continuous line, we use this
 * function. We could at the same time, draw rectangles, etc.
