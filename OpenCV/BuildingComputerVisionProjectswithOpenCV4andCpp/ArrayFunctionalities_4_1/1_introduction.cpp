/**
 * Motivated by the normalization method of an array often used, we find the core header in OpenCV full of
 * operations that we can perform on arrays. These operations include calculating non-zero element,s LUT (look
 * up table) operations, matrix decomposition, the merge and split ops, and so many other operations.
 * 
 * We shall examine them one by one as the need arises
