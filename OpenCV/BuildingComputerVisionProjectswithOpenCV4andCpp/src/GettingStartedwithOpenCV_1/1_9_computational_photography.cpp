/**
* Computational photography refers to using advanced image processing techniques to improve the images captured by 
* cameras. Instead of focusing on optical processes and image capture methods, computational photography uses 
* software to manipulate visual data. Applications include high dynamic range imaging, panoramic images, image 
* relighting, and light field cameras.
* 
* The photo and xphoto modules contain various algorithms that provide algorithms pertaining to computational 
* photography. There is also a module called stitching that provides algorithms to create panoramic images.
