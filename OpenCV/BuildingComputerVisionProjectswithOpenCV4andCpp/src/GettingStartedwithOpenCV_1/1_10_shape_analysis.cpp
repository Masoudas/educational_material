/**
* The notion of shape is crucial in computer vision. We analyze visual data by recognizing various different shapes 
* in the image. This is actually an important step in many algorithms.
* 
* Let's say we're trying to identify a particular logo in an image. We know that it can appear in various shapes, 
* orientations, and sizes. One good way to get started is to quantify the characteristics of the shape of the 
* object.
* 
* The shape module provides all the algorithms required to extract different shapes, measure similarity between 
* them, transform the shapes of objects, and more.
