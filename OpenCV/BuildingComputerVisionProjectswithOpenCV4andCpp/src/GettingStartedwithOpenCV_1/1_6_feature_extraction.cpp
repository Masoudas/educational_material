/**
* The human visual system tends to extract the salient features from a given scene to remember it for retrieval 
* later. To mimic this, people started designing various feature extractors that can extract these salient points 
* from a given image. Popular algorithms include Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded Up Robust 
* Features (SURF), and Features From Accelerated Segment Test (FAST).
* 
* An OpenCV module called features2d provides functions to detect and extract all these features. Another module 
* called xfeatures2d provides a few more feature extractors, some of which are still in the experimental phase. 
* 
* There is also a module called bioinspired that provides algorithms for biologically-inspired computer vision 
* models.
