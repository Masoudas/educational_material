/**
* We are increasingly interacting with devices that can capture the 3D structure of the objects around us. These 
* devices essentially capture depth information, along with the regular 2D color images. So, it's important for us 
* to build algorithms that can understand and process 3D objects.
* 
* Kinect is a good example of a device that captures depth information along with the visual data. The task at 
* hand is to recognize the input 3D object, by matching it to one of the models in our database. If we have a 
* system that can recognize and locate objects, then it can be used for many different applications.
* 
* There is a module called surface_matching that contains algorithms for 3D object recognition and a pose 
* estimation algorithm using 3D features.
