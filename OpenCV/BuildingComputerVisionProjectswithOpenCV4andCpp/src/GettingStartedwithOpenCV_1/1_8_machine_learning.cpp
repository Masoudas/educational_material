/**
* Machine learning algorithms are used extensively to build computer vision systems for object recognition, image 
* classification, face detection, visual search, and so on. 
* 
* OpenCV provides a module called ml, which has many machine learning algorithms bundled into it, including a 
* Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, neural networks, and 
* more.
* 
* It also has a module called Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Library (FLANN), which contains algorithms 
* for fast nearest neighbor searches in large datasets.
