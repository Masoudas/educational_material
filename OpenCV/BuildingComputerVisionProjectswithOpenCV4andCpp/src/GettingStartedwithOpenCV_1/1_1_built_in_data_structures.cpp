/**
* OpenCV provides several built-in data structures, such as Image, Point and Rectangle, which are optimized in
* terms of memory and speed, and can be used for all applications. These are written in the CORE module.
* 
* It provides modules for reading and writing image files of all kind of formats, in the imgcodecs module. Writing
* an image as a png or any other format is as simple as writing a single line.
* 
* It also provides modules for reading and writing video files in the videoio modules. We can even save a bunch of 
* frames as a video file by setting properties such as frames per second, frame size, and so on.
