/**
* The module 'highgui' is used for the purpose of visualizing images, and other high level operations we may 
* require.
* 
* There is a waiting function that will wait until you hit a key on your keyboard before it goes on to the next 
* step. There is also a function that can detect mouse events. This is very useful in developing interactive 
* applications.
* 
* Using this functionality, you can draw rectangles on those input windows, and then proceed based on the selected 
* region.
