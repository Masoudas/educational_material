/**
* The module 'imgproc' contains many of the operations we normally use on images. These operations include rotation,
* transformation, brightness adjustment, etc.
* 
* There is another module, called ximgproc, which contains advanced image processing algorithms such as structured 
* forests for edge detection, domain transform filter, adaptive manifold filter, and so on.
