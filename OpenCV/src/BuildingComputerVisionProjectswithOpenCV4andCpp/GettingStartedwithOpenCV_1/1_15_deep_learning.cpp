/**
* Deep learning has a big impact on computer vision and image recognition, and achieves a higher level of accuracy 
* than other machine learning and artificially intelligent algorithms. Deep learning is not a new concept; it was 
* introduced to the community around 1986, but it started a revolution around 2012 when new GPU hardware was 
* optimized for parallel computing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementations and other techniques 
* allowed the training of complex neural network architectures in reasonable times.
* 
* Deep learning can be applied to multiple use cases such as image recognition, object detection, voice recognition, 
* and natural language processing. Since version 3.4, OpenCV has been implementing deep learning algorithms—in the 
* latest version, multiple importers for important frameworks such as TensorFlow and Caffe have been added.
