/**
* Video analysis includes tasks such as analyzing the motion between successive frames in a video, tracking 
* different objects in a video, creating models for video surveillance, and so on. OpenCV provides a module called 
* video that can handle all of this.
* 
* There is also a module called 'videostab' that deals with video stabilization. Video stabilization is important, 
* as when you are capturing videos by holding the camera in your hands, there's usually a lot of shake that needs 
* correcting. All modern devices use video stabilization to process the video before it's presented to the end 
* user.
