    -   Smoothing filters:
    GaussianBlur, MedianBlur, Averaging.
    Bilateral filters:  Used for blurring while keeping the edges sharp.
    See Also denoising filters in computational photogrammetry.
    
    -   Derivate filters
        -   Sobel derivative:
    Determines the derivative of the image in x or y direction using the Sobel filter. Note that Sobel 
    derivatives are of course positive and negative. See Filters_4, 1_1_Sobel_Derivative_filter.cpp.

    -   Pyramid filters:
        - Gaussian filter:
    The Gaussian pyramid generation is done by starting with an initial image g_0 and then lowpass filtering 
    this image to obtain a "reduced" image g_1. The image is "reduced" in the sense that both spatial density 
    and resolution are decreased. This operation can be continued to obtain a set of images {g_0,g_1,g_2, ...,
    g_n} that form the pyramid image structure. The low pass filtering is done by a procedure equivalent to 
    convolution by a set of local symmetric weighting functions (for example a Gaussian distribution). A fast 
    algorithm for generating such a Gaussian pyramid structure. Along with the Gaussian pyramid generation, 
    there is also an approximate reverse process of the pyramid generation that tries to expand a reduced image 
    to its original scale. The same algorithm that is used to form the pyramid can also be used to perform the 
    expansion operation.

    -   Morphological filters:
    For thinning (erosion), thickenning (dilation) and many other functions on an image. See the section
