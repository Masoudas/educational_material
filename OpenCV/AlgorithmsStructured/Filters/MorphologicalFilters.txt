I recall using thinning morphological filters for our tortuosity project.

Morphological transformations are some simple operations based on the image shape. It is normally performed on 
binary images. It needs two inputs, one is our original image, second one is called structuring element or 
kernel which decides the nature of operation. Two basic morphological operators are Erosion and Dilation. Then 
its variant forms like Opening, Closing, Gradient etc also comes into play. 

-   Erosion (me: Thinning)
The basic idea of erosion is just like soil erosion only, it erodes away the boundaries of foreground object 
(Always try to keep foreground in white).

-   Dilation (me: Thickenning)
It is just opposite of erosion. Here, a pixel element is '1' if atleast one pixel under the kernel is '1'. So 
it increases the white region in the image or size of foreground object increases. 

-   Openning
Opening is just another name of erosion followed by dilation. It is useful in removing noise,

-   Closing
Closing is reverse of Opening, Dilation followed by Erosion. It is useful in closing small holes inside the 
foreground objects, or small black points on the object. 

-   Morphological Gradient
It is the difference between dilation and erosion of an image. (Me: So if we stretch the shape a bit and then
remove a thinned version of it. we almost get the boundary of the shape.)

The difference between the image and its openning

-   Bottom Hat
The difference between the image and its closing.
