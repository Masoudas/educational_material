Feature detection algorithms involve those algorithms that extract features from an image.

    -   Canny edge detection:
Developed by canny for detecting edges in the image. Uses Sobel filter for derivates of x and y. See 
FeatureDetectionAlgorithms_4_2, 1_1_Sobol_Derviate_filter.cpp

    -   Blob detectors
Used for detecting blobs in images. See FeatureDetectionAlgorithms_4_2, BlobDetectors.
