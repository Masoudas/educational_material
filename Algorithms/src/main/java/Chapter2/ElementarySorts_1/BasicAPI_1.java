/**
 * As is the case with java, we need only to sort an array of Comparable
 * objects. An object that implements the Comparable API is said to have natural order.
 * Hence, the following API is proposed, where two elements are
 * compared and a method less returns a bool saying whether one object is less
 * than the other.
 * 
 * We should note that putting the assertion method is not sufficient for checking 
 * that the array is sorted! For example, a sort algorithm might just fill the array with
 * equal elements!
 * 
 * Some sort algorithms need no extra memory to sort an array, whereas other might use
 * another array of the same size to do the sorting. We should be cautious about this fact.
 * 
 * The compare method must have three properties:
 * 1- Reflexive: For all v, v=v
 * 2- Antisymmetric: If w < x and x < w, then x = w
 * 3- Transitive: if x<=w and w<=z then x<=z;
