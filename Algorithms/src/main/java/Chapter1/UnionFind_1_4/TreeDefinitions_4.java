/**
 * (I guess a tree is a combination of Nodes and Links. I guess a tree can have subtrees, which
 * are again trees by themselvers. Hence for example, 1->2 3->4 has two (sub)trees).
 * 
 * The size of a tree is the number of its nodes.
 * 
 * The depth of a node is the number of links from that node to its root.
 * 
 * The height of a tree is the maximum depth among all its nodes.
