     * The for loops seems to evade me every time. As we know we have (initialization; condition; iteration).
     * 
     * I think one of the best ways to look at it is as that:
     * 1- First time, the initialization is played, then condition.
     * 2- From second time, iteration is played, then condition.
     * 
     * Here's what I mean:
     * for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++);
     * 
     * 1- i = 0. 0 < 2;
     * 2- i++. 1 < 2;
     * 3- i++ 2 == 2;
     * 
     * How many times the loop is executed? till i < 2, which would be twice.
