1-
a) It is incorrect. ? has to come after a char or a group, there's nothing to repeat.
b) Correct. A question mark plus any char plus beginning of word (?a fs)
c) Incorrect. Order should be {1,4}. Otherwise it means not not a digit, which is a digit. Here's something.
This pattern in the form [^\D]{1,4} would find {11234} four matches here and a one match. That's why we need the greedy option, which we
have in Java.
d) Correct. Start of string, then a negate of carrot. Like the following line:
1
e) Incorrect. Special chars should be escaped. 
f) Incorrect. Form \++ is correct.
g) see f.
h) Correct. Match two plus signs.


2-
a) ^[+-]?\d+(\.\d+)? A start of string. After that, zero or one plus or minus sign, then zero or one digits, then a group of
zero or one point and a one or more digit. So like the following line: 
(Question: Is this a greedy match in VS code? Because 3333 is found only once.)
3333
+123.132
+123

b) \b[aeiou][a-z]{,4}\b: A word boundary (start or end), then one char from aeiou, maximum of four from a-z, word boundary.
Hence for example: axx or ouc

c) [.?!]\s+([A-Z][A-Za-z]*): 
!   Z
