1-
a) It is incorrect. ? has to come after a char or a group, there's nothing to repeat.
b) Correct. A question mark plus any char plus beginning of word (?a fs)
c) Incorrect. Order should be {1,4}. Otherwise it means not not a digit, which is a digit. Here's something.
This pattern in the form [^\D]{1,4} would find {11234} four matches here and a one match. That's why we need the greedy option, which we
have in Java.
d) Correct. Start of string, then a negate of carrot. Like the following line:
1
e) Incorrect. Special chars should be escaped. 
f) Incorrect. Form \++ is correct.
g) see f.
h) Correct. Match two plus signs.


2-
a) ^[+-]?\d+(\.\d+)? A start of string. After that, zero or one plus or minus sign, then zero or one digits, then a group of
zero or one point and a one or more digit. So like the following line:
+123.132

3-
a) Gerunds: The pattern is [a-zA-Z]{7,}(ing|ING), 
Examples are Interesting, GroundBreaking, DISHEARTENING

b) Abbrevations: 
        We assume that we have a pattern of one alpha(bet) and one dot, ending in dot. Hence \b([A-Z]\.)+\b
    U.S.A., U.S.S.R.
        If there's no dot at the end, we'd write "([A-Z]\.)+[A-Z](\s|$)". The space or dollar sign are put there to indicate
    that we want to search for single words. Otherwise, U.S.S.R. would still have been a match (which is correct, but we still
    wanted words). 
    U.S.A 

c) Consonant-Vovel pattern: 
        Let's assume we're really talking about CV. The pattern is "\b([BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ][AEIOU])+(\s|&|\b)".
    Hence, LENA. SONATA
        Of course, if the reverse was needed too, we'd need to add an | to the beginning as well.

d) Time-stamp:
        We can write \d\d:\d\d:\d\d. If we wanted to get cute, we could write (\d{2}:){2}\d{2}. If 
    If we wanted to be more precise, we could have said [0-2]\d:([0-5]\d:){2}

    
4- The regular expression to get such occurances is "[!?\.]+", which would work for !! ?? ...
However, we can use the grouping property for replacement, by writing ([!?.]+). However, this does not
distinguish between groups for us to override them. We have no other choice but to search three times
I guess, same way we have to write the function with three ifs.

6- Be careful that you can't extract a website by just saying "\w". The answer to this question depends on the 
patten of the website name. Say for example we know that they all start with http(s)://domain_name.domain/optional_extra,
I'd write (https?://[\w/\.-]+\.\w+[\w/\.-]+)
