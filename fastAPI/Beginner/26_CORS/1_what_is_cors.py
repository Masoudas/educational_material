CORS (cross origin resource sharing) refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different "origin" than the frontend.

ME: Is this complicated? Nope. When the front-end loads in the browser, then if the code for front end calls a resource that's not on the JS code loaded in the browser, then it has a CORS.
