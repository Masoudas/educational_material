Note messages have keys and values. To delete old messages, we have to cleanup policies:

    -   Retention: purge old messages (time or size based)
    -   Compaction: Keep latest message per key

Note also that the key is what is used for partitioning event messages. For example, we use hashes of keys to choose the partition to write messages.
