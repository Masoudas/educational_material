Persistent continuous queries (CQ):
    -   Take one or more input STREAMs/TABLEs and compute a result STREAM or TABLE
    -   Deployed in the ksqlDB servers
    -   Executed in a data-parallel manner
        -   Scalable
        -   Fault tolerant

Transient queries:
    -   CLI / Java client / etc.
    -   Pull queries: Simple state lookups against TABLEs. These are equivalent to traditional queries.
        -   "classic" queries
        -   Limited in ksqlDB (no aggregations or joins)
    -   Push queries: Subscription to a result STREAM.

ME: The difference between the two has to do with the fact that transient queries are usually simpler, and more complex queries have to be defined as persistent queries.

Syntax is:
$ CREATE STREAM resultStream
    AS SELECT ...

$ CREATE TABLE resultTable
    AS SELECT ...

Notice that we may append streams and tables together. The video insists that these streams and tables are written back to kafka.
