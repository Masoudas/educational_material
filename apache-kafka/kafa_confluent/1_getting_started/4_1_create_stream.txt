ME: As it appears, one cannot use messages directly, but rather we need streams or tables.

Note that streams and tables are created in ksqldb, and by running the corresponding the queries in the editor window.

What is a stream:
    -   A stream is a an immutable, append-only collection that represents a series of historical facts, or events. After a row is inserted into a stream, the row can never change. You can append new rows at the end of the stream, but you canâ€™t update or delete existing rows.

Here are two examples of creating a topic:
$ CREATE STREAM pageviews_stream
  WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='pageviews', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');

This stream contains all the fields in this topic. ME: We may also use selected fields from this topic:

$ CREATE STREAM pageviews_partial_stream (
    VIEWTIME BIGINT, 
    USERID STRING
)
  WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='pageviews', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');
