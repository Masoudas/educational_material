Datum: defines the center point, orientation, and scale of the reference surface related to a coordinate reference system. Same coordinates can relate to different locations depending on the Datum! For example, WGS84 is a widely used global datum. ETRS89 is a datum used in Europe. Coordinate reference systems are often named based on the datum used.
