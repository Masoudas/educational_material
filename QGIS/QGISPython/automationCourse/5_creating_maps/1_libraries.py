Leaflet is a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive maps for webpages (OpenLayers is another JavaScript library for the same purpose).

Here, will focus on two Python libraries -mplleaflet and Folium - that are able to convert our data in (geo)pandas into interactive Leaflet maps.

Other interesting libraries for creating interactive visualizations from spatial data:
    -   mapboxgl
    -   Bokeh
    -   Geoviews

We can also convert maptlotlib plots directly to interactive web maps using mllpleaflet. All you need to do is to:
    -   visualize your data using matplotlib (or geopandas plot())
    -   convert the plot into a webmap using mplleaflet
