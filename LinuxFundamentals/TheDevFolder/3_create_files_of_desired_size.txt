The dd Unix utility program reads octet streams from a source to a destination, possibly performing data 
conversions in the process. Destroying existing data on a file system partition (low-level formatting):

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ <destination partition>

Creating a 1 MiB file, called foobar, filled with null characters:

dd if=/dev/zero of=foobar count=1024 bs=1024

Note: The block size value can be given in SI (decimal) values, e.g. in GB, MB, etc. To create a 1 GB file 
one would simply type:

dd if=/dev/zero of=foobar count=1 bs=1GB

Note: Instead of creating a real file with only zero bytes, many file systems also support the creation of 
sparse files which returns zeros upon reading but use less actual space.

Exercise: Write a file of 2KiB to RAM?
Answer:
$ df    # Find a ram partition tmpfs
$ cd /dev/shm
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=f bs=1024 count=2
