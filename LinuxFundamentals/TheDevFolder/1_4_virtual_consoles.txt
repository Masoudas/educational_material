As we may already know, virtual consoles of Linux can be accessed using alt+ctrl+F keys.

Press Ctrl-Alt-F2 to switch to console 2. On some distributions, the login information includes the tty 
(Teletype) device associated with this console, but many do not. It should be tty2 because you are in 
console 2. To come back to GUI, we should normally press alt+ctrl+F7, because terminal 7 is where the GUI
is being run. In my Ubuntu distro, it was with F2.

Login as a non-root user. Then you can use the who am i command—yes, just like that, with spaces—to 
determine which tty device is connected to this console.

Let's do the following long listing of tty2 and 3. 
$ ls -l /dev/tty[23]    # Insteresting way of listing similar file names
crw--w---- 1 masoudas tty 4, 2 avril 22 08:30 /dev/tty2
crw--w---- 1 root     tty 4, 3 avril 22 08:37 /dev/tty3

As device files, there is nothing special about them; they are simply character type devices. We will use 
these devices for this experiment. The tty2 device is attached to virtual console 2 and the tty3 device is 
attached to virtual console 3. Also, notice that the major and minor number on this machine are 4, and then
2 and 3 respectively. 

Note: It's also interesting that the owner of one is masoudas and the other is root. This is because right
before I long listed, I opened up the terminal! This implies that everytime a use accesses a termina, they
become its owner.

Now if we type the following in terminal three, it will be printed in termina four (we should become 
super user for it. Just sudo is not enough):
$ echo "Printing in terminal 4 from terminal 3" > /dev/tty4

Me: As another experimet, pts is the terminal we open in GUI. We can do the same experiment and see the same
result. In particular, note that for example when you open a bash in VS Code, there's a number there that
says "3:bash". Everytime we open a terminal one of these pts (pseude terminal) is created in the /dev/pts
folder, to which we can send messages. How many can we open? I went as far as 126, and then gave up!

Note: To print which pseudo terminal a console is connected to, type:
$ tty
