Here, we have some of the most important files in this folder documented:

-   /dev/loop
The first loopback device. Loopback devices are used for mounting filesystems which are not located on other 
block devices such as disks. For example if you wish to mount an iso9660 CD ROM image without burning it to 
CD then you need to use a loopback device to do so. This is usually transparent to the user and is handled 
by the mount command. 

-   /dev/null # The famous null to which we send things we don't want! $ ls > /dev/null
The bit bucket. A black hole where you can send data for it never to be seen again. Anything sent to /dev/null will disappear. This can be useful if, for example, you wish to run a command but not have any feedback appear on the terminal. It is a character device on major node 1 and minor node 3.

- /dev/stoud, /dev/stdin, dev/stderr
The famous command line operations. ls > /dev/stdout is equivalent to ls.

- /dev/random or /dev/urandom
These are kernel random number generators. /dev/random is a non-deterministic generator which means that the 
value of the next number cannot be guessed from the preceding ones. It uses the entropy of the system 
hardware to generate numbers. When it has no more entropy to use then it must wait until it has collected 
more before it will allow any more numbers to be read from it. /dev/urandom works similarly. Initially it 
also uses the entropy of the system hardware, but when there is no more entropy to use it will continue to 
return numbers using a pseudo random number generating formula. This is considered to be less secure for 
vital purposes such as cryptographic key pair generation. If security is your overriding concern then use 
/dev/random, if speed is more important then /dev/urandom works fine. They are character devices on major 
node 1 with minor nodes 8 for /dev/random and 9 for /dev/urandom.

-   /dev/sda
The first SCSI (Small Computer System Interface ) drive on the first SCSI bus. The following drives are named 
similar to IDE drives. /dev/sdb is the second SCSI drive, /dev/sdc is the third SCSI drive, and so forth.

-   /dev/ttyS0
The first serial port. Many times this it the port used to connect an external modem to your system.

-   /dev/zero
This is a simple way of getting many 0s. Every time you read from this device it will return 0. This can be 
useful sometimes, for example when you want a file of fixed length but don't really care what it contains. 
It is a character device on major node 1 and minor node 5.
