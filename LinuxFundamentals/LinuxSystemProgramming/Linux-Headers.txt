In this cheat-sheet file, I shall summarize all linux and C-headers that we encounter:

	-	unistd.h
Contains standard symbolic constants and types in Linux, such as mod_t (file mode,) _POSIX_VERSION, functions for getting
uid, pid, etc, setsid, setuid, fchown, etc. Many of the standard tasks of Linux are done using this header file.

	-	sys
The sys header contains information that can be extracted about the underlying machine, like RAM, n-Cores, etc.  
man pages are syscalls.
	--	sys/types.h
	The types used be the sys functions.

	-	linux
Contains a series of subheaders related to the current linux system:
	--	linux/limits.h
	Limits on many Linux related entities, like PATH_MAX, etc

	-	fcntl.h
file control options. Functions like 'creat' for making a file, or open for establishing a relationship between a file and
file descriptor, ...

	-	errno.h
Contains errno variable and the associated error macros (like EACCESS, etc.)
