Note that the program we just wrote actually reads from stdin. Hence, we can easily pipe it with another
program. Again, don't forget that the stdout is all the lines that are written to the output (for example, it
doesn't send each single line of the ls command to ./program, then return, then send the other one, etc.):

$ ls / | ./program
$ man ls | egrep "^[A-Z]+$" | ./program
