Linux and other Unix systems have strong scripting support. The whole idea of Unix, from the very beginning, 
was to make a system easy to develop on. One of these features is to take the output of one program and make 
it the input of another program—hence building new tools with existing programs. We should always keep this in 
mind when creating programs for Linux. The Unix philosophy is to make small programs that do one thing only—and 
do it well. By having many small programs that do only one thing, we can freely choose how to combine them. 
And by combining small programs, we can write shell scripts—a common task in Unix and Linux.
