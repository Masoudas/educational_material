Eric S. Raymond has written some excellent rules to stick to when developing software for Linux and Unix. They can 
all be found in his book, The Art of Unix Programming. Two of the rules that apply to us in this recipe include 
the Rule of Modularity, which says that we should write simple parts that are connected with clean interfaces. The 
other rule that applies to us is the Rule of Composition, which says to write programs that will be connected to 
other programs.
