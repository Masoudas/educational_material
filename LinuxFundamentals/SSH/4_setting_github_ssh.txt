Github is also using the same ssh communication structure. Note that everytime we clone a repository, the
clone Window actually says "Clone with SSH." This implies that once copying takes place, there's no further
need to define an ssh key.

We can however set up an authorized key for a remote, by taking the following steps:

    -   Create an ssh key on the remote.
    -   Copy the PUBLIC key into the setting->SSH and GPG keys
    -   Add the private key to your ssh, using the ssh-add ~/.ssh/private_key

We see that Github actually adds the public key into its authorized keys as such.
