-   IP address:
    It's used to signify the devices on the network. Example is 192.168.1.1

-   Subnet mask:
    It's a way to segment a network, so that some devices can't talk to each other, even though they might be on 
    the same physical network.

-   Default gateway:
    The router for the subnet we're on. If we want to connet to a device (IP address,) our machine first starts to
    look for it on the local network. If it can't be found, then we connect to the default gateway to look for it
    all over the world. 

-   DNS:
    How is www.microsoft.com server reached? Note that we only have IP addresses, and the domain name is superficial.
    Hence, we need a global mechanism to convert domain names to IP addresses. This would be done through a data 
    base that holds the correspondence between domain name and IP addresses. Of course, we don't want to implement
    such a huge DB per machine, so we implement a global one and each machine over the net sends requests to it.
    This what we call a DNS sever (Domain Name Server).
    So in fact, if we put IP addresses in the internet explorer, we will be able to connect to serves, same as we 
    can with domain names.
    Once we get the IP address and communicate with the DNS, we again search for it on the local network, and then
    over the net, like before.
