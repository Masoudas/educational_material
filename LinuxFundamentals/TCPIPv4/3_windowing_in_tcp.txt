Windowing is the process of data transmission from one computer to another.

The protocol was devised for doomsday military scenarios. Supposedly, the communication lines would be too noisy,
hence data will be transmitted in windows by this protocl. First, one computer sends a couple of bytes, then upon
receipt and acknowledgement, the amount of data is doubled (or something to that effect.) If acknowledgement is not
received, then transmission is halted, and once again everything restarts from a couple of bytes.
