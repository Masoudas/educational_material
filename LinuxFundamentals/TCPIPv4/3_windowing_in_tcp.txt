Windowing is the process of data transmission from one computer to another.

The protocol was devised for doomsday military scenarios. Supposedly, the communication lines would be too noisy,
hence data will be transmitted in windows by this protocl. First, one computer sends a couple of bytes, then upon
receipt and acknowledgement, the amount of data is doubled (or something to that effect.) If acknowledgement is not
received, then transmission is halted, and once again everything restarts from a couple of bytes.

Consequently, a document is broken into packets and sent step by step to ensure the quality of the transmission 
line.

This is actually the reason why sometimes we see slowing down of downloads. This is because windowing takes place
and sometimes the entire packet transmission restarts. This is why TCP/IP4 is a bit not great for real time communication,
because a small number of packets may not be enough to continue a real-time communication.

TCP/IP is OSI layer 4 (transport layer)
