We can get the ip address for TCP/IP v4 and v6 as follows:

$ ip -4 address
$ ip -6 address

The outcome is something like this:

""""""""""""""""""""""""""
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: wlp0s20f3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet 192.168.43.158/24 brd 192.168.43.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute wlp0s20f3
       valid_lft 3468sec preferred_lft 3468sec
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

As we can see, with a wifi (mobile phone) module connection, we have two addresses:

    - lo: From what I understand by a search over the internet, lo is what is used inside the machine for local
      software to talk to my broadcast modules (inside my machine,) allowing it that broadcast module to then to
      broadcast the information. In other words "the kernel will send that data to interface lo instead of sending 
      it to your external network." You see that it't type is not broadcast.

    - wlp0s20f3: This is the name of the wifi module I'm connected to, and it has assigned ip addresses on subnet
      masks to me. The interpretation of the inet (which is the v4 ip address) is quite interesting. We see that it is
      192.168.43.158/24. The first part is the ip address, and the twenty four is for the subnet masks. It implies 
      that twenty four bits are one, implying 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask!

    - eth0: Wired connections are named as eth, which is what we usually call such connections.

    - If I check the ip address of my android phone (devic>about>ip address) I see that my phone is assigned a 
      completely different ip address to connect to the internet.
