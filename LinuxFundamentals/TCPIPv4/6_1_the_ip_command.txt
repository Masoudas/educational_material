The ip command is a Linux net-tool for system and network administrators. IP stands for Internet Protocol and as 
the name suggests, the tool is used for configuring network interfaces.

The general format of the command is:

$ ip [OPTION] OBJECT {COMMAND | help}

OBJECTS (or subcommands) that you will use most often include:
    1. link (l) – used to display and modify network interfaces.
    2. address (addr/a) – used to display and modify protocol addresses (IP, IPv6).
    3. route (r) – used to display and alter the routing table.
    4. neigh (n) – used to display and manipulate neighbor objects (ARP table).

Hence for example, we write:
$ ip link       # More precisely, ip link show
$ ip address    # More precisely, ip address show

and to get help for these commands, we can write:
$ ip link help
$ ip address help
