To get the default gateway, we use the "route" option of the ip command. It essentially tells us how the traffic
is routed from our computer to other computers.

$ ip route
    default via 10.188.0.1 dev wlp0s20f3 proto dhcp metric 600 
    10.188.0.0/16 dev wlp0s20f3 proto kernel scope link src 10.188.246.192 metric 600 
    169.254.0.0/16 dev wlp0s20f3 scope link metric 1000 

Note that the default is indicated with the default word actually. (me: dev above means device, and not developer
you morron :D)

To add a non-default gateway for an ip address, we need to specify for which ip address we want to add it and what
its value is. For example, below, we add the default 192.168.2.254 for the ethernet ip address 192.168.2.0/24:
$ ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.2.254 dev eth0

and we can delete the address as follows:
$ ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.2.254 dev eth0

In order to add a default gateway, we just need to add the word default and recall the name of the network:
$ ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 # Same command for delete.
