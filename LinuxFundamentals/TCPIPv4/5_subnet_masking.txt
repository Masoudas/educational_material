TCP/IP consist of four octets (8 bit numbers.) Hence, we have 
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Hence the value 192.168.1.1

Note that we can have multiple machines connected to the same router, but they can be part of different subnets,
making it impossible to connect to one another.

The IP address tells us both about the sub-net and the machine on the subnet. The subnet contains for example the
first 8 (or 10, etc) bits of the address, and the rest of the bits are dedicated to the machine address. Hence, it
depends on how many subnets we want (for machines not be able to connect to one another,) and how many mahcines 
we have on that subnet.
