The MAC address (Media Access Control Address) as we may recall is the unique identifier of the network device.

To get the MAC address, we can use the ip command one more time. Note that the address appears under the option
"link" and not "maddress":

$ ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: wlp0s20f3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 9c:29:76:43:35:eb brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

MAC address appears after the label ether. Hence, my wifi module has the address 9c:29:76:43:35:eb.
