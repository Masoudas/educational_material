The df command (or disk free) as the man pages say "report file system disk space usage." Hence, we can see
how much space is available for each file system. Note that the root is a file system, the boot is also a file
system, as well as the home folder. The good thing as we showed for mounting hard drives for example is that
the name of each partition also appears with this command, which help us mount the partition we seek.

$ df -h

udev            7,7G     0  7,7G   0% /dev
tmpfs           1,6G  2,3M  1,6G   1% /run

/dev/nvme0n1p1  146M  100M   47M  68% /boot/efi
tmpfs           1,6G   16K  1,6G   1% /run/user/125
tmpfs           1,6G   32K  1,6G   1% /run/user/1000

We notice above that the root file system (/) has 59G of space, and the name of the corresponding partition is
/dev/nvme0n1p5. Also notice that the Windows EFI is located at /dev/nvme0n1p1. What's interesting is that the
partition for the Windows drives are not shown in this list, because the computer I'm working on at this point
has a dualboot linux and Windows.

Note that we can use df with a particular destination to see the amount of space available for that file system
as well.
$ df -h /home
