Once again, every device that's attached to a linux kernel can be found in the /dev folder. In particular,
the usb devices will appear as ttyUBSn, n=0,....

Reminder: Once again, don't forget that "$ ls /dev | grep ttyUSB*" greps ttyUS as well ttyUSB. This is 
because in the grep context, * means zero or one. Use the following instead

$ ls /dev | grep ttyS   # ttyS is found in the line, not whole word.
ttyS0
ttyS1
ttyS10
ttyS11
ttyS12
...

Why do we have these many ttySn? Apparently, not all ttys or ttySs are physical ports, and some of them are
virtual ones, for sending commands like Ctrl+C for example.

Note: apparently tty0 to ttyn are the same terminals that we open by pressing alt+ctrl+f1 for example.

More precisely:
    -   First, /dev/tty is at process level, it can be ttyn(tty1, tty2,...), ttySn(ttyS0, ttyS1), 
        pty(pts/0, pts/1), and something else.

    -   /dev/tty0 is a alias of current(foreground) virtual console, so it could be tty1, tty2, and so on. 
        Notice that ttyS0 is not a alias; It's the first serial port.

    -   /dev/console is the system console, it points to /dev/tty0 as a default. It can be ttyn, ttySn, 
        ttyUSBn, lpn, and so on.
