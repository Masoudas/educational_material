The keys for moving the cursor:
    - h:    Move left
    - j:    Move down
    - k:    Move up
    - l:    Move right.

Hence, we can combine these words with numbers to, for example 5j, 2k, 3h, 10l, to move around as many 
positions.

To move around as much as a word:
    - w: Move forward
    - b: Move backward.

Note: Vim has two kinds of word objects: referred to as lowercase "word" and uppercase "WORD". In Vim world, word 
is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores separated by white space. WORD is a sequence of any non-blank 
characters separated by white space.

Consider for example animal_farm(pig, horse). Hitting w from a brings us to ( and on it (first letter after the
set of chars mentioned), wheres hitting W brings us to the next letter after blank space and on it. In fact, 
space is skipped in both cases. The same goes for b or B. (Hence, if we copy, white space is taken as well with
each of w, W, b, B.) If I were on the white space on the other had, it will go to the word adjacent to the white
space.

Note that with w, if we have a series of chars like (^#) etcetra attached to one another as standalone, they are 
also considered one word.

Now, contrary to w which stands in the beginning of the word, e go to the end of the word. If it's currently
on a word, it goes to the end of that word, otherwise to the end of the next word (if it's on a whitespace or
the end of current word.)
