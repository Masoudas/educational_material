Vim keeps track of changes on the file. Use u to undo changes, and ctrl+r to redo the changes. Use '.' to
repeat the last action you performed, which is different from redo.

Vim also allows you to persist undo history between sessions, which is great if you want to undo (or remember) 
something you've done a few days ago!

You can enable persistent undo by adding the following line to your .vimrc:
set undofile

However, this will litter your system with an undo file for each file you're editing. You can consolidate the 
undo files in a single directory, as seen in the following example:
" Set up persistent undo across all files.
set undofile
if !isdirectory(expand("$HOME/.vim/undodir"))  
    call mkdir(expand("$HOME/.vim/undodir"), "p")
endif
set undodir=$HOME/.vim/undodir
