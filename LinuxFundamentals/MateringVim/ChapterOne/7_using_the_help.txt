The help command comes with :help or :h. Use ':h command' to search for a particular command. Also, use
arrow keys. or ctrl+b and ctrl+f to navigate forward and backward.

:help is a command which navigates a set of help files. As you look through the help files, you'll notice that 
certain words are highlighted in color. These are tags, and can be searched for using the :help command. 
Unfortunately, not every tag name is intuitive. For instance, if we wanted to learn how to search for a string 
in Vim, we could try using the following:

$ :h search

However, it looks like this command takes us to the entry on expression evaluation, which is not exactly what 
we were looking for. To find the right entry, type in :h search (don't hit Enter yet) followed by Ctrl + d. 
This will give you a list of help tags containing the substring search.
