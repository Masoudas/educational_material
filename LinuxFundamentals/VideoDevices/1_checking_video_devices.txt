This issue was particularly important when I was trying to capture images with video camera using opencv.

Like any other device, the video cameras (like webcam) are under the /dev folder, under the 'video*' Each video
device is associated with one integer, which is why for example in the VideoCapture class of openCV we call them
by integers.

To get the list of available video devices, a long listing with a wildcard is a good idea:
$ ls -l /dev/video*
