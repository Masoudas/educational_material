Like any other device, the attached storage devices appear in the /dev folder. In fact, one of the ways to
ensure that the disk has been recognized (and not necessarily mounted) by the OS is to check and see if 
a file appears corresponding to the disk in this folder. It's rather interesting that usb storage devices are 
not mounted as ttyusb, but rather as sda or sdb (which stands for storage device.)

Consider a simple usb derive I attached to the PC (and it has two partitions). As soon as I did that, the
following three files appeared in this folder:

$ ls /dev
...     sda 
sda1    sda2
...

In fact, here's how we check whether these devices have been recognized by the machine in this rather crammed
folder. We get an ls, and store it in a file. Then we get another ls, and then we compare the diff of the two,
to see if any new files have been added. Note that we use ls -l to have one line per folder, to use diff
a bit more effectively.

Note: I had to search for "pipe diff to get to the formula for finding diff with std out, which is using -
for the argument"

$ ls -l /dev > ~f
# Attach device
$ ls -l | diff f -


We get the following then:
