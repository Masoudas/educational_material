As it appears, when we write the mount or mount, we're in fact mounting one of these files. Consider wanting
to mount something that appears at /dev/sda1 on -df -h. What I write usually is:

$ sudo mount /dev/sda1

What I'm mounting here is this char special file inside the dev folder associated with the disk.
