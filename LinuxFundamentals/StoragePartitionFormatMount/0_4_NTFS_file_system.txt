NTFS (New Technology Files System) is the newer drive format. Microsoft introduced NTFS in 1993. NTFS, on the 
other hand, is fully read/write compatible with Windows from Windows NT 3.1 and Windows XP up to and including 
Windows 8. Mac OS X 10.3 and beyond have NFTS read capabilities, but writing to a NTFS volume requires a third 
party software utility like Paragon NTFS for Mac. Theoretically, NTFS is limited by design to 16EB (Exabytes). 
One Exabyte is the equivalent of one billion Gigabytes, so we're quite a ways away from maxing out NTFS. In 
practice, 2 to 4TB volumes are the limit at this time. Larger volumes will require a 64-bit OS and compatible 
hardware.

While file transfer speed and maximum throughput is limited by the slowest link (usually the hard drive interface 
to the PC like SATA or a network interface like 3G WWAN), NTFS formatted hard drives have tested faster on 
benchmark tests than FAT32 formatted drives. Other factors will be in play, however, including drive technology 
(HDD vs. SDD, Flash vs. non-Flash, etc.) and file fragmentation (on spinning drives).
