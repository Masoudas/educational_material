Using the df command, we can see the list of all mounted devices, and in particular the location where they're
mounted.

Suppose we want to unmount something. All we need to do is to run the 'umount' command (note that this is umount
and not unmount, there's no n.)

$ umount /dev/sda

Once again, suppose we want to mount the device (something I used to do often at Inmed) All we need to do is to 
recall the command "mount [device_name | ip_address] destination"

$ sudo mount /dev/sda   ~/USB   # Some folder I've created with the 700 permission for example.
$ sudo mount 192.167.0.1    ~/server    # Folder with proper permission

And this way, we've mounted the device.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To format the device, we need to first umount the device, then we need to make a file system for the device,
using the mkfs command as follows:

$ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda # Or could be mkfs.fat /dev/sda, etc.
Alternatively:
$ mkfs -t partition_type location
