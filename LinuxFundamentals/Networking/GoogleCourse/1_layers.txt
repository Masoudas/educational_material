TCP has five layers (OSI has seven:)

    -   The physical layer: IT represents the physical layer for connecting, like cables, network cards.
    -   The Data link layer: This is the ethernet and wifi layer, the module used for sending information.
    -   The network layer (or network access layer:) Responsible for delivering data across networks. We have 
        the concept of ip in this layer indeed. IP (internet protocol) is the most common protocol in this
        layer. There's client and servers on each node.
    -   The transport layer: Sorts out which servers and clients are supposed to get the data transported in
        the network layer. The TCP protocol is the most famous example in this layer, which stands for transmission
        control protocol.
    -   The application layer: These are the applications that use the data. Like browsers, email apps, etc.
        (Me: I think the https and ftp fall into this category.)
