A packet on the network layer is called an ip datagram.

It has two sections, header and payload. First section of header indicates version (ipv4, ipv6). Then, there's header. There's a QoS
field then. There's a TTL or time to live field. Everytime a router gets the frame, it reduces TTL, so that there's no cyclic loop indicates
routers.
