A router is a network device that forwards traffic depending on the destination address of that traffic.

Basic routing is simple:
    -   A data packet is received.
    -   The router examines the ip address of the destination
    -   The router looks for the destination network in the routing table.
    -   The router forwards the traffic to the closest destination network possible.


Say two networks A of 192.168.1.0/24 and B of 10.0.0.0/24 are connected to a router. The router on network A has ip of 192.168.1.1 and of 
10.0.0.254 on network B. Remember that ip addresses belong to networks, not individual nodes on the network.

So let's say a computer with address of 192.168.1.100 sends a packet to 10.0.0.10. The computer knows this ip is not on its network, so it
sends it to the mac address of its gateway (the router.)

See figure 1. So the router takes the ip datagram from the ethernet frame, and sees the destination ip address. Then, it sees the network is
the one right away after it. Even, the router has the MAC address of the node in its ARP table. The router then forms a new data packet, 
sending all the data to that destination. It decrements the TTL by the way. It also changes the source ip address to itself, rather than the 
actuall sender.
