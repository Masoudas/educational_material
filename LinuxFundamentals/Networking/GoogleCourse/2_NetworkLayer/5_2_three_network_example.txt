Now, consider the three network example of Fig. 3, and assume that 192.168.1.100 wants to send to 172.16.1.100.

So it sees that it's not on it's local network based on ARP table, so it sends to the router. Router sees that it's not on its
table, so it sends a broadcast message, and router B responds. Router B then forwards it to the MAC address of 172.16.1.100.

Note that routers are usually connected to many networks. Use traceroute to determine which path is taken to send data to a certain
ip.
