Traditional subnetting was not enough, so CIDR came along. Especially, the number of host ips were either too large, or too small.

Class-less Inter Domain Routing (CIDR) is more flexible, and useful for demarcation, that is to distinguish, or to set things off. 
Demarcation means to describe where one network ends and another one begins. With CIDR, the network ID and subnet ID are combined into one.

The slash notation we used "ip_address/n" comes from CIDR, allowing us to express id with two numbers. Now, we can change n, to be class-less.
For example, ip_address/23. With 23, we'd have 9 host ips, which 2^9 (usually minus 2 as we said) hosts.
