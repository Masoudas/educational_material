Four octets of binaries. 12.34.56.88 is valid, but 123.456.789.100 is not.

IP addresses are distributed to companies, etc, instead of being determined like MAC addresses by companies.
For example, IBM has every single ip address that starts with 9! So each destination ip that s
starts with 9 must be routed to IBM routes.

Note that IP addresses belong to networks, not to the devices attached to them. Hence, if I have a server at the university
and want to ssh to it remotely, I just need to know the network address to that, and once I know it, that address is unique (for sometime at least)
Or for example, my laptop would have a different ip address 
anywhere I connect (me: but probably this is unique in the world, so that I can ssh to it anywhere I want.)
