With subnets, some bits that are used for host ids are in fact used for subnet ids. 

At the network level, core routers only care about network ids. They use them to forward the packets to the 
gateway routers. The gateway router has additional info to send the data into the destination machine or the next
router. 

Subnet ids are calculated using subnet masks. These are 4 octets as well.  

Consider 9.100.100.100 ip addresses. A subnet masks has two sections. The beginning part  which is a mask itself
is a string of ones, 255.255.255.0. The part with zeros tell us what to keep. The purpose of the mask is to tell the
router which part is the subnet id. Here' it's the first three here. We know that for class A, the first octet is the
network id. So, consider the last three. The numbers that are remainging that correspond to ones are the subnet id,
so 100.100 part is the subnet id. So the last 100 is the host id.

Usually, a subent can use two less than the number of host ids avaialable. So, here we have 256, meaning we usually have 
at most 254 ips for the subnet mask. (zero usually is not used and 255 is reserved for broadcasting.)

Consider subnet mask 255.255.255.224. This is 27 ones followed by 5 zeros. This means that we have 5 bits of host ips. Now, a quick hand
of writing this subnet mask is to write ip_address/27. This implies 27 bits for mask.
