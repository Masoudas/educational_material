It's fourty eight bits, or 6 octets (8 bits).

The first twenty four identify the manufacturer (vendor) of the device.

If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is zero, it means that ethernet frame is intended for

If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means we're dealing with a multicast frame.
