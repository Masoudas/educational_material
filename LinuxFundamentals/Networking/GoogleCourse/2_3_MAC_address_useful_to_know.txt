Ethernet is the most common method of sending and receiving data on the data link layer. Ethernet is a fairly
old technology, and is the same from the 80s. 

Ethernet for reducing collision domain uses CMA/CD for checking the network, seeing the network is empty, tries
to send the data. Yet, all devices on the network yet access the same data. This is where the Media Access Control
(or MAC) address came to play, allowing to determine the receiver of data in a collision domain.
(Me: WIFI uses MAC too I guess. They have one as well)

It's fourty eight bits, or 6 octets (8 bits). Hence, two hexadecimals represent one octet. MAC addresses are 
globally unique, among all manufacturers.

The first twenty four (3 octets) identify the manufacturer (vendor) of the device. The second three determines
the device number.

Unicast: Transmitting to only one receiver.
Multicast: Transmitting to many receivers.
Broadcast: Transmitting to all receivers.

If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is zero, it means that ethernet (data) 
frame is intended for only the destination address. (Huh?) So the frame is received only by the intended destination.

If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means we're dealing with a 
multicast frame. (Huh?) A multicast frame is sent to all devices, but is received or discarded by each device 
based on their criteria. 

A broadcast address is all ones, so that devices can learn more about each other.
