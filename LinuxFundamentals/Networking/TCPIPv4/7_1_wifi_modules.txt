Often, it's the wifi module that has many networks available to it (because an ethernet connection comes from
one source by cable.) We can list the available wifi networks using the nmcli command.

NMCLI stands for command line tools for controlling network manager.

A simple run of the nmcli on my machine leads the following (equivalent to passing the status option):

$ nmcli
wlp0s20f3: connected to Wifirst/B Estudines Nedelec     # The local network I'm connected to on this machine
        "Intel Wi-Fi"
        wifi (iwlwifi), 9C:29:76:43:35:EB, hw, mtu 1500
        ip4 default
        inet4 10.188.246.192/16
        route4 0.0.0.0/0
        route4 10.188.0.0/16
        route4 169.254.0.0/16
        inet6 fe80::127e:8cc4:24f5:d40e/64
        route6 fe80::/64

p2p-dev-wlp0s20f3: disconnected
        "p2p-dev-wlp0s20f3"
        wifi-p2p, hw

lo: unmanaged
        "lo"
        loopback (unknown), 00:00:00:00:00:00, sw, mtu 65536

DNS configuration:
        servers: 10.188.0.1
        interface: wlp0s20f3

So, we see that command list many featurs, especially the DNS server, which we need to check for from the 
/etc/resolv.conf file.
