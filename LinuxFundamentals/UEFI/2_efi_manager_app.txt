A very powerful on linux for managing efi boot can be installed as follows:

$ sudo apt-get install efibootmgr

Once the program is installed, running the command name lists all the EFI boot loaders on the system (note that
my current system has a dual boot Windows and Linux):
$ efibootmgr
BootCurrent: 0002
Timeout: 0 seconds
BootOrder: 0000, 0002 0005
Boot0000* UEFI KBG40ZNS512G NVMe KIOXIA 512GB 80CPD0NFQ2D1 1
Boot0002* ubuntu
Boot0005* Windows Boot Manager

We can see all three efi boots listed. A hex number has been assigned to each (we can't have more than four 
primary partitions on MBR.) Also, the star next to each one indicates that they're active. Finally, we can also
see the current boot program, as well as the order of boot.

Note: Boot0 is the one that probably load GRUB and prepare both Linux and Windows boot for us. Although interestingly
enough, setting boot to ubuntu does the same thing as well.

As always, we can run --help to see what options we have available with this command. Hence for example, to change
the boot, we run as follows:

$ sudo efibootmgr -o 0005 0002 0000
Now, Windows would be the main boot, and goodness me, it doesn't care about other efi, just jumps straight into
Windows asking to switch to Ubuntu efi for example!
