Some Linux commands interact with the user input through the standard input (which is your keyboard by default). 
For example, the read command reads input from the user and stores it in a variable. For example, you can run the
command read weather:

$ read weather # Waits for the user to input text for the weather variable.
The weather is sunny    # This is what we type in.
                        # By pressing enter, a new local variable is created.
$ echo $weather

Note that the stream from the keyboard is read AS LONG AS we don't hit enter. So, if we hit enter before typing in
any other char, the variable content would be null.
