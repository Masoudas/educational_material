One of the main principles in Linux is that Each program does one thing well and thus, every Linux command is 
designed to accomplish a single task efficiently. Unleash the real power of Linux commands by combining their 
functionality to carry out more complex tasks!

The piping structure of Linux is as follows:

command 1 | command 2 | ...

where | means pipe.

As an example, suppose we want to show only the fifth line of a text file. Here's the command we will use:
$ head -n 5 file.txt | tail -n 1

Notice that we use tail to show the fifth line. If I had said:

$ head -n 5 file.txt | head -n 1

it would have shown only the first line.

We can use more than one pipe as follows:

$ lscpu | head -n 4 | tail -n 1     # Display fourth line of lscpu
