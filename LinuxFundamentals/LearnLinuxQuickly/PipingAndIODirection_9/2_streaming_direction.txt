Most Linux commands work with three different streams of data:

    - Standard input (also referred to as stdin)
    - Standard output (also referred to as stdout)
    - Standard error (also referred to as stderr)

Most of the commands we have discussed so far produce some output. This output is sent to a special file called 
standard output (also referred to as stdout). By default, the standard output file is linked to the terminal, and 
that's why every time you run a command, you see the output on your terminal. Also, sometimes commands will produce 
error messages. These error messages are sent to another special file called standard error (also referred to as 
stderr), and it's also linked to the terminal by default.
