To direct the output of a command to file, use the single > command. To append to an exisitng file, use the normal
stream operator. It appends the output to the end of the file. Note that > creates the file if it does not exist.

Note: Sometimes some commands have no output. In such cases, we need to use the echo command to first ensure that
there's an output (that is the thing we write is echoed,) then we can stream it.

Example 1:
Suppose we want to stream 'cd /' to a file. Here's what we do:

$ echo "cd / ">> file.txt  # Note that cd does not have any output by itself.

Example 2:
Suppose we want to export a new environment variable to .bashrc. Note again that the export command has no output.
Hence, we echo it:

$ echo "export my_var=/home/masoudas" >> .bashrc    # If you write > .bashrc, you're screwed!
