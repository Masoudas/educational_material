So, in this very interesting example, we count the number of lines of code in a repository (say all c
files:)

$ find . -name '*.c' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l

Again, remember why we use 0. Also, recall that we could have used ls here as well.

Note: This would count the number of white space lines as well. Could we do something about it? Well, one
solution I find over the Internet was to use sed to replace the lines:
$ sed -s '%s/^$//g'

Unfortunately, uniq does not work! Aha! tr is the solution here. We can squeeze together multiple \n
together with -s option:
$ tr -s '\n' file_name


Note:
If you want more statistics about your source code, a utility called SLOCCount, is very useful.
