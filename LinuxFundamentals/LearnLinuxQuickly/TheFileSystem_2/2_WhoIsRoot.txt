As we already mentioned, root has its own directory in the root folder. 

WHO IS ROOT?

The root user is a superuser who is allowed to do anything on the system. The root user can install software, add users, 
manage disk partitions, etc. The home directory of the root user is /root, which is NOT to be confused with / (the root of the 
filesystem).
