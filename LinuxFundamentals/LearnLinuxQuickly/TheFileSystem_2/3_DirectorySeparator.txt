THE DIRECTORY SEPARATOR

In Linux, the forward slash (/) is the directory separator or sometimes referred to as the path separator. In Windows, 
it's the other way around because a backward slash (\) is used instead as a directory separator. However, be careful since the 
leading forward slash is the root of our filesystem. For example, in /home/elliot/Desktop, only the second and third forward 
slashes are directory separators, but the first forward slash represents the root of the filesystem.


ABSOLUTE VERSUS RELATIVE PATHS

An absolute path of a file is simply the full path of that file and, it ALWAYS begins with a leading forward slash. For example, 
/opt/- google/chrome is an example of an absolute path.

On the other hand, a relative path of a file never starts with the root directory and is always relative to the current working 
directory. For example, if you are currently at /var, then log/boot.log is a valid relative path.

Note: We may want to recall absolute, canonical and relative path at this point, where canonical paths did not contain dot or 
dot dot, but absolute ones could.


There are two special directories under every directory in the filesystem:
. is the current directory
.. is the parent directory

Question: What is ../../ (or ../..)? It means the parent folder of the parent folder of the current folder.
