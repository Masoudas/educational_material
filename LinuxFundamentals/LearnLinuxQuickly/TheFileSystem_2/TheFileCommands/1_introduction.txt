The file command is useful for performing several operations on files and folders, including search for a particular
pattern, replace the pattern, etc.

The basic syntax is:

$ find . -name name

This exprssion looks for the given expression RECUSIVELY from this location to all subfolders, among files and
folders. Note the recursiveness. Especially if we're thinking about changing file names in the current folder,
we'd be screwed!
Also note that we used the -name. To use regular expression, we need to supply -regex.


To set the depth of search, use the -maxdepth option

$ find . -maxdepth 1 -name expression     # Search only in the current folder.

To search for files or folders, use the -type option together with f or d
$ find . -type f -maxdepth 0 -name expression
