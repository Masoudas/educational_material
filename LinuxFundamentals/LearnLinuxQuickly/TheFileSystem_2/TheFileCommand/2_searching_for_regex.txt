Life is hard, suck it up!

To search for reqular expressions, we need to supply the type of regex, together with the regex. The problem with
regex is that regexes are read as whole words, hence the path need to be supplied by a '\.*/pattern", meaning 
search for all the paths.

Hence, for example, to search for a pattern '1_*.txt' (meaning like 1_1_f.txt or 1_3_f.txt) we must write:
$ find . -type f -regextype egrep -regex '1_\w+.txt' # (note that 1_*.txt means zero or more _, which is
wrong.)

Note that egrep stands for extended grep, allowing for additional meta regex chars, like regex -E.
