We can pass the result of the find command outside to be used by other commands using the following four options:

-   exec command ;


-   exec command {} +
    find . -type f -exec file '{}' \;

    Runs `file' on every file in or below the current directory.  Notice that the braces are enclosed in single 
    quote marks to protect them from interpretation as shell script punctuation. The semicolon is similarly 
    protected by the use of a backslash, though single quotes could have been used in that case also.

-   execdir command ;

-   execdir command {} +
