Here we summarize the ls command:

Note that by default, ls shows the modification time. We can use u to show access time and sort by it. We can
use t to sort by modification time. r for both means reverse order.

Writing the command ls -la, the letter 'd' that appears in the attributes of some the folders indicate directory, and l indicates
link files. 
The letter 'a' means --all. Note that only when we put this a do we see . and .. directories. This is because both of 
these are hidden directories inside the current directory!

$ ls    # lists in rows. sorts by name from a to z, numbers first
$ ls -l # long. Prints all attributes of files
The output of the ls -l command (except for some particular folders like /dev folder) is as follows:
-rwxrw-r--    1    root   root 2048    Jan 13 07:11 afile.exe

    -   file permissions (-rwxrw-r--),
    -   number of (hard) links (1), (me or the number of folders inside, including .. and ., hence minimum
        is always two)
    -   owner name (root),
    -   owner group (root),
    -   file size in bytes (2048),
    -   time of last modification (Jan 13 07:11), and
    -   file/directory name (afile.exe)

$ ls -d     # Only shows the dirs, not their contents. Means shows the path to it I guess!
$ ls -lu    # shows the access time of the file, and does not change the order based on name.
$ ls -R     # Recursively shows the folders as well.
$ ls -lt    # t sorts by modification time
$ ls -lr    # Reverses the order of list
$ ls -lh    # Prtins disk usage in humanly readable manner.
$ ls -1     # One file per line (no long listing)

The most popuular format of listing a folder is by ls -latr, where t sorts by modification time, and r 
reverses it, making oldest modified first.

Note that we can't sort based on change time.
