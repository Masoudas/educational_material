The test command is a simple utility for checking whether or not a variable is empty and a file or a folder
exists.

$ test -f file  # The file exists (in this folder)
$ test -d folder    # The directory exists or not
$ test -e file_or_folder    # Checks either exists as a file or a folder.
$ test -z $VAR  # Tests whether the given variable is empty (like a string zero test in shell)
$ test ! -d folder  # Test folder does not exist
$ test -f file && echo "exist" || echo "Does not exist" # If returns true, and is not short-circuited and
                                                        # execute exists and short circuit or. Otherwise,
                                                        # execute does not exist
