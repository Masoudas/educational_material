'lscpu' is used for listing the characteristics of the CPU, which is equivalent to list CPU.
We can use 'lshw' to list the hardware on the device.

The command 'uptime' is used for showing how long the system has been up, how many users are logged on, etc. It's interesting
that in my Windows virtual Debian (at least) the up time is the time the virtual Linux has started working, not the time the
machine has fired up since this morning!

The last part of this command is the load average of the system over the past, 1, 5 and 15 mins. 

WHAT IS SYSTEM LOAD?

In simple terms, system load is the amount of work the CPU perÂ­forms at a given time. So the more processes (or programs) running 
on your computer, the higher your system load is, and fewer processes running leads to a lower system load

Hence, load average is the average amount of load over the past 1, 5 and 15 min.

For example, load average: 1.00, 3.00, 7.00 shows that over the past minute, there's been less work done by the CPU than the past
5 or 15 min. In other words, the system load is decreasing. However, 5.00, 3.00, 2.00 shows an increasing workload.

The command 'reboot' restarts the system. There's another more sophistaced with 'sysctl reboot' as well.

The command free -h shows the amount free space in humanly readable terms.

The top command actually shows a summary of all we've discussed thus far.
