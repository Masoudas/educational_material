'pwd' prints the present working directory, where ~ is always the path /home/current_user.

ls lists the pwd. ls -la lists the pwd with permissions associated. Also, ls path lists the given path. Note that the date
shown in front of each file name is the 'Last Modification Date'.

The command 'ls -l -d dir_path' shows what's going on with only the given dir path. The -u option shows the access time of the file
instead of modification time. The option -t sorts the listing based on modification time, and if passed with -u based on access
time.

The -R option in the ls command allows us to list the content of each sub-directory as well.

The most popuular format of listing a folder is by ls -latr, where t sorts by modification time, and r reverses it, making oldest
modified first.

The command df -h shows the amount of space available in each basic folder of linux in a humanly readable format.
