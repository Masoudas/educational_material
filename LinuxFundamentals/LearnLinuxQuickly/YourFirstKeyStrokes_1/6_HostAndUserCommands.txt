The command psswd changes the password for the current user. The command hostname prints the name of the host.

The command 'uname' displays the system's kernel information. When you run the uname command without any options, then it will 
print just the kernel name. The options -r and -v are release and version, respectively.

'whoami' prints the name of the current user.

The command 'su' means switch user. So we can write 'su other_user' to switch to a different user.
