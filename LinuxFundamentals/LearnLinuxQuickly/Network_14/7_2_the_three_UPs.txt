On my machine, if I list the ip address, I see the following three UPs:

wlp0s20f3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000

	-	First UP indicate that the network is physically up (me: probably the network as well as my card)
	-	Second UP indicate that the cable is connected and up
	-	Third UP after state indicate the network is up software-wise

Now, to bring the software aspect up or down, we need to work with the network interface, which is the link
suite of the ip command (where can also get the MAC address.) To do so, we just need to write the name of the
device, and then down or up:

$ ip link set dev wlp0s20f3 down

Then we see in address section:

wlp0s20f3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default qlen 1000
...

which makes you wonder whther the three UPs are actually useful, because all of them went down together when we
just turned off the software part!
