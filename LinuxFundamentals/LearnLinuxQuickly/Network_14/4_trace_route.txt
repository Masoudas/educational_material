To trace route using ip command, we can use the route suite:
$ ip route get address

Notice that for example if I type 127.0.0.1 (which is the loopback address of this machie) I get:
$ ip route get 127.0.0.1

The traceroute traces the route it takes from this machine, through the (default) gateway to the destination.

For example, if I write:

$ traceroute asroma27.com
# Goes through 30 channels to get there!
