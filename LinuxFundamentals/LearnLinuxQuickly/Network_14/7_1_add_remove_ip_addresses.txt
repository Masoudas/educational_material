To add an ip address to a particular dev, well, we need to use the addr suite, and then call the dev we intend, and
finally use add to add our new address. The stipulation is that dev must be after the ip address we want to add:
Note that if an ip address already exists for this device, it will be added, which is kind of odd I must admit
for me!

$ ip addr add 192.168.1.1 dev eth0

To remove an ip, we simply replace it with del:

$ ip addr add 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
