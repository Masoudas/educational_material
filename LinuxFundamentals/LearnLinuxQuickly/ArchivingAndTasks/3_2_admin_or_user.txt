Note that when we type crontab -e, we're actually defining tasks for the root user. Therefore, any task will
be run with the user privileges. 

Now, we can either explicitly define some users are allowed and others are not allowed to define crontabs, which
is through the /etc/cron.deny and /etc/cron.allow files.

Beside that, we need to open crontab with a particular user name with the -u option to define tasks as such:
$ crontab -u $USERNAME -e

Note that in Ubuntu at least, running the following command means creating tabs for current user
$ crontab -e

And we actually better be specific for root user jobs:
$ crontab -u root -e
