Using tar, we can compress and decompress files and folders. The basic syntax of the command is 'tar files_folders,' and this command compresses the files 
and foldres. But we normally supply it with the following options:

-   'c'
    Compresses and adds to the existing archives. Does not delete the content of the original archive

-   'v'
    For being verbose.

- 'z'
    Extra compression, turns the archive into what we call a tarball. We need to add .tar.gz to the archive name by hand to indicate that this is a tarball.

-  'p'
    Keep the permission of files as is, otherwise changes the permission, which is not good if we're backing up the root for example.

- 'f'   
    Give a name to this archive.

Note that we should put 'f' as the last option, otherwise the name would not be associated with the tar ball, and it throws an error. Moreover, whatever folder
name we supply to compress, it will be the first folder name in the tarbal, even if it were '.' (so archive.tar.gz has on its root '.')

Example:
tar  -cvzpf backup.tar.gz source    (source is the first folder in the archive)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To untar a tarball, we need to change the 'c' option to 'x'.

- 'x'
    Decompress the tarball

We also supply the '-C' option after giving the name of the tar to indiace where we want it decompressed. Note that the destination folder is not overriden.

Example:
tar -xvpzf  backup.tar.gz -C destination/
