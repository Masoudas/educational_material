A cronjob is set using crontab. It can be set by the superuser or other users.

The command 'crontab -e' opens the file to set such jobs. On the top we notice

m                h                d                   m           dow                                                        command
0 to 59     0 to 23         1-31            1-12            0 (sunday) to 6 (saturday)                      command-name

Examples: 
Every two hours, list a folder:

*               2                   *                   *               *                   ls

Every Tuesday at 8 o'clock, get a backup of the entire system:
*               8                   *                   *               2                           tar -cvzpf                      /           

Every minute, of every hour, of everyday, of every month, get a backup
*               8                   *                   *               2                           tar -cvzpf                      /
