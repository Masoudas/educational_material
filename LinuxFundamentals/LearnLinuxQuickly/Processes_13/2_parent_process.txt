A parent process is a process that has started one or more child processes. A perfect example will be your 
terminal and your bash shell; when you open your terminal, your bash shell is started as well.

For example right now in my vscode, there's a bash open, which I can check by typing tty:
$ tty
/dev/pts/2

To get the id of the parent of this process, we can use grep with pts/2 for example:
$ ps -fu $(id -u) | grep pts/2

And then it prints, funny enough:
masoudas    5456    4868  0 14:58 pts/2    00:00:00 /bin/bash
masoudas    6722    5456  0 15:13 pts/2    00:00:00 ps -fu 1000     # :D The first process I ran here!
masoudas    6723    5456  0 15:13 pts/2    00:00:00 grep --color=auto pts/2 # The second process I ran here!

And this clearly shows that the parent process of this bash is 4868. To get what process that is, I run the
ps command with pid:

$ ps -f --pid 4868  # Or simply -p instead of pid
masoudas    4868    4825  0 14:57 ?        00:00:01 /usr/share/code/code /usr/share/code/resources/app/out/bootstrap-fork --type

Voila! We see that this process is run as part of vscode.
