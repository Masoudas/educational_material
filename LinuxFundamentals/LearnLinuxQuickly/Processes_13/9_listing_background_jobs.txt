As we already mentioned, we can send a job to the backgroud using the & operator. We can also use the bg
command to send a job to the background:

$ bg    # Resume the most recently suspended job and run it in the background
$ bg %{{job_id}}    # Resume a specific job (see below) in the background. See below on job_id.

As we may already know, we can suspend a job using the kill command, together with SIGSTOP signal. Another way
of course is to press CTRL+Z.

To list the background jobs, we can use a command named jobs to list all processes running in the background:

$ jobs -l
$ jobs %{{job_id}}  # Status of a particular job. Note that job_id here does not mean process_id, but rather 
                    # the job number that appears as part of the jobs -l below in brackets. It starts with 
                    # [1])

To send a particular job from background to foreground, we can use the fg command, which stands for foreground:

$ fg # Bring most recently suspended background job to foreground
$ fg %{{job_id}} # Bring a specific job to foreground
