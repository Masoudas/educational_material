A foreground process is a process that is attached to your terminal. You have to wait for a foreground process to 
finish before you can continue using your terminal.

On the other hand, a background process is a process that is not attached to your terminal, and so you can use 
your terminal while a background process is running.

For example, when we run firefox, or cmake-gui, the terminal has to wait for these processes to finish, before
another process could run in the terminal. Another example is the famous yes command:

$ yes MY_SENTENCE

This would run for eternity, unless we kill the process (find it by pgrep and kill it.)

To send a process to background, it suffices to place an ampersand in front of the process name:
$ cmake-gui &
[1] 7830

The number is the process id. If we fully print the process with this id, we get:
$ ps -fp 7830
masoudas    7862    5456  1 15:55 pts/2    00:00:00 cmake-gui

We see that it's still being run as part of the process 5456 (which is the bash of this terminal) Consequently,
the process is still attached to the terminal, but runs in the background.
