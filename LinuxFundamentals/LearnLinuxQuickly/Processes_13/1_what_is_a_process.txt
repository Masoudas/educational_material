A process is simply an instance of a running program. So any program running on your system is a process.

Me: recall the difference between process, thread and task.

And just like the case with files, every process is owned by a specific user. The owner of a process is 
simply the user who started that process.

To list all the processes that are owned by a specific user, you can run the command ps -u followed by the 
username:

$ ps -u username
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   1510 ?        00:00:01 systemd
   1511 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
   ...
   1606 tty2     00:00:00 gdm-x-session
   1608 tty2     00:07:36 Xorg
 138498 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
    ...
 138535 pts/0    00:00:00 cmake-gui
 138550 pts/1    00:00:00 ps

Note that some of the virtual processes are run on tty0, others on pts (pseudo terminal.)


And to print all processes of all users:
$ ps -e
