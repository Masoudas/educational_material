We can generate the checksum for a (iso package) and compare it with what it should be, usually on the pages
of the distributor. That way, we can check whether a package version is authentic or not.

The command we look for is sha256checksum:

$ sha256sum package

There's also similar commands that can be found as well:
$ sha1sum file1 file2 ...
$ md5sum file1 file2 ...

The integrity of a file can be verified as follows:
$ md5sum filename > file_sum.md5	# First calculating the checksum at some point
$ md5sum -c file_sum.md5	# Now, comparing the result.

We can also use sha1deep and md5deep commands to recursively calculate the sha of an entire directory, though
these commands have to be installed:
$ sha1deep -rl directory_path > directory.md5	# -r is for recursive, and l is to set relative path rather than
												# absolute paths inside the file names.		

Here's something a bit more complicated using find, for calculating sha of all folders:
$ find directory_path -type f -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum >> directory.md5

Another algorithm which is stronger is openssl hashing together with SALTing, which is a string added to further
obfuscate the password:
$ opensslpasswd -1 -salt SALT_STRING PASSWORD
$1$SALT_STRING$323VkWkSLHuhbt1zkSsUG.
