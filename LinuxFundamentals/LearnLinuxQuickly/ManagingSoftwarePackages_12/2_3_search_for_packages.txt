Using the apt-cache command, we can search for packages:

$ apt-cache search keyword

The -n option would display only packages that have keyword in their package names:
$ apt-cache search -n keyword

Note also that we can search for a package with dpkg too:
$ dpkg -s package_name

We can show the information and dependency of the packages as follows:
$ apt-cache show package_name
$ apt-cache depends package_name
