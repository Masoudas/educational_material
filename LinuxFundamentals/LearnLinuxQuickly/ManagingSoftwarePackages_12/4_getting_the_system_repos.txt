There are two ways to get the repos through which we look for repositories:

-   Using the policy option:
$ apt-cache policy

If we supply the package name after policy, it will tell us which repo was used to get the package from:

-   list files
The repositories are included in the file /etc/apt/sources.list and in any file with the suffix .list under 
the directory /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. You can check the man page:
$ manpage sources.list
