To update a particular package, we pass the only-upgrade option

$ apt-get install --only-upgrade Package

Then we have two commands to update and upgrade the packages on the system:

$ sudo apt-get update 
It will update the list of available packages and their versions, but does not do any installation.

$ sudo apt-get upgrade
The actuall installation and unpacking.

In Linux lingo, the process of upgrading all the installed packages on your system is called patching 
the system.
