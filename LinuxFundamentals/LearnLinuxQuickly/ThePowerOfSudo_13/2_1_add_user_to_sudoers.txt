To add a user to the group of sudoers, we can directly edit the /etc/sudoers file. However, its recommended
to use the editor dedicated to this file, which allows us to detect error upon recompilation of this file.

The editor dedicated to this file is a vi editor (I guess), called visudo, which is funny enough, a nano
editor:

$ sudo visudo

The most interesting lines are in a plain such file:
root   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
%sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

The syntax to add a new user to the group of sudoers is as follows:
user hosts=(user:group) commands    # Commands have to reference the actuall binary file.

Example:
masoudas ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/bin/apt-get install terminator # A package

So note that in the above:
    - We passed two commands, separated by ','
    - The second command has options passed to it

We can also use aliases inside this file to manage a certain group of users together:
User_Alias MANAGERS = smurf,bob

The same way, we can define aliases for commands:
Cmnd_Alias USER_CMDS = /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/userdel, /usr/sbin/usermod

And this is how they are used:
MANAGERS ALL=(ALL) USER_CMDS
