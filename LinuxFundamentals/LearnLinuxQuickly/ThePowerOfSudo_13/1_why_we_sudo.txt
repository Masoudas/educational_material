Recall that sudo implies switch user and do, to which we can apply user names as well

$ sudo -u user_name id -u

We use sudo to let non-root users have super-user priviliges. Note that the sudo password does not necessarily
have to be the same as the root password, and we can change the root password as follows:

$ sudo su
# passwrd

Ok. So now, notice that in the above command, we said sudo su, and not su. In fact, in my Ubuntu machine,
I can't switch with su as long as I haven't set the password like above. Why?

First, note that sudo means perform one command as the root user. So when I say sudo su, I'm switching user 
as sudo. Note that when we install ubuntu, we set the password for sudo (and not for root.) In fact, root
does not have a password as long as we don't set one like above. However, with the above command I'm saying
    [1] Let me become the super user
    [2] Now, as super user, let me change account to root!

Now, inside I'm setting the password. Therefore:
$ su    # Asks for the root password (the one I just set)
$ sudo su   # Asks for sudo password

In conclusion, the obvious difference between sudo an su is that, when run as root:
    -   sudo does not change user. It just runs the command. su changes to root
    -   su asks for root user password, sudo asks for sudo password.

Famously over the Internet, they say "When you install Ubuntu, the standard root account is created, but no 
password is assigned to it. You canâ€™t log in as root until you assign a password to the root account."
