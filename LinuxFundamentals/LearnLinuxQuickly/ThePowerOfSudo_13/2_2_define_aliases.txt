We can also use aliases inside this file to manage a certain group of users together:
User_Alias MANAGERS = smurf,bob

The same way, we can define aliases for commands:
Cmnd_Alias USER_CMDS = /usr/sbin/useradd, /usr/sbin/userdel, /usr/sbin/usermod

And this is how they are used:
MANAGERS ALL=(ALL) USER_CMDS
