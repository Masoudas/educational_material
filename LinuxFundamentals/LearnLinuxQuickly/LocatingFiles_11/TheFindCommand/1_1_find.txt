The find command is useful for performing several operations on files and folders, including search for a particular
pattern, replace the pattern, etc.

The find command uses the following strategy:  find descends through a hierarchy of files, matches files that meet 
the specified criteria, and performs some actions. The default action is to print the names of files and folders, 
which can be specified with the -print option.

To print all the paths descending from a folder then, use the following, which will print all the paths and 
folders:

$ find path [-print|print0]

Note that -print separates each path with '\n'. To separate with a '\0', we can use the -print0 option:

Note that as such, we can pass the resulting files to the xargs command to perform some action on them:
$ find path [-print|print0] | xargs ls -l
