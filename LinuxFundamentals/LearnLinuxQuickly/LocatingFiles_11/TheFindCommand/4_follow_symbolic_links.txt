By passing the -L option, we force find to follow symbolic links (as well as of course checking the file itself.) If the
link points to the original path, the command will be stuck.

Consider the proc folder, wherein there are several symbolic links for each process, and consider the following command:

$ find -L /proc -maxdepth 3 -name 'bundlemaker.def' 2>/dev/null

This command finds all files as such, to a depth of tree (the current folder, children, and grandchildren folder.) Notice
that we send error messages to the null sink hole. Those messages would be about recursive loops.
