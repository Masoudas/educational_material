Over the internet, it's been suggested to use the mass move command:
$ mmv 'Friends - 6x?? - Tow *.srt' 'S06E#1#2.srt' 

For example, this command moves Friends - 6x05 - Tow Joey's Porshe.srt to S06E05.srt

Now, the question is, how can I keep a part of the regex? Like for example if I have a pattern that starts with
5 (say 5_file 5_5_file,) and I want to change the five in the beginning to 1, how do I go about it?
I can use a wild card as follows (note that the quotes are necessary):

$ mmv '1*' '2#1'

For mor complicated patterns, I can use a combination of '?' and '*' to perform the actions:

$ mmv '?_1*' '#2_2#1'   So move the first character to last position, move remiander to beginning, and then
                        change _1 to _2
