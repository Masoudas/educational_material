The manpage of updatedb states that "updatedb creates or updates a database used by locate(1). If the database 
already exists, its data is reused to avoid rereading directories that have not changed."



Note that when we create a file in an open shell, the instance of db that's already loaded inside this shell
does not contain this file. Hence, we need to run the 'updatedb' command to ensure that it's updated.
