vi is apparently the editor of choice for many. It has two modes:
1- insert mode: Allows us to insert text into the file.
2- command mode:  Allows us to work with commands, such copy, paste, etc. A file is by default opened in the command mode.

i       Inserts text before the current cursor position.

I       Inserts text at the beginning of the current line.

a       Appends text after the current cursor position.

A       Appends text after the end of the current line.

o       Creates a new line below the current line.

O       Creates a new line above the current line.

To switch back to the command mode, pres Esc.

In the command mode, there are shortcuts for commands, and there are commands that have to be fully written. The latter is done
by pressing :, which opens a new line at the end of the editor, where we can type in the command.

yy                  Copy (yank) the current line.
3yy                 Copy (yank) three lines (starting with the current line).
yw                  Copy (yank) one word starting at the cursor position.
2yw                 Copy (yank) two words starting at the cursor position.
p                   Paste after the current cursor position.
P                   Paste before the current cursor position.
dd                  Cut (delete) the current line.
4dd                 Cut (delete) four lines (starting with the current line).
dw                  Cut (delete) one word starting at the cursor position.
x                   Delete the character at the cursor position.
u                   Undo the last change.
U                   Undo all changes to the line.
/red                Search for the word red in the file.
:%s/bad/good        Replace the word bad with good.
:set number         Show line numbers.
:set nonumber       Hide line numbers.
:7                  Go to line number 7.
G                   Jump to the end of the file.
gg                  Jump to the beginning of the file.

Tip:
You should know that :%s/old/new will only replace the first occurrence of the word old with new on all the lines. To replace all 
the occurrences of the word old with new on all the lines, you should use the global option :%s/old/new/g

Now, to save the file and quit vi, we have the following options:
:w	Save the file but do not quit vi.
:wq	Save the file and quit vi.
ZZ	Save the file and quit vi (same as :wq, just faster!).
:x	Save the file and quit vi (same as :wq or ZZ).
:q	Quit vi without saving.
:q!	Forcefully quit vi without saving.
