This is taken from a couple of videos.

To allow for insertion of text to begin, press a.

In the command mode, most operations in Vim are compounded ones. Hence, we 'delete + word' or 'yank + word' or 
'paste':
    - delete word with 'd + w'.
    - delete line with 'd + l'.
    - Pressing dot repeats last operation.

The verbs in Vim are:
    - d: delete
    - c: change (delete and insert)
    - y: yank (copy)
    - >: Indent (note that if > is on dot, then it will repeat the last operation. Hence, don't forget to press
                shift for this one!)
    - v: Visually select
