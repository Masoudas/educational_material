The capital G is the command that takes to a particular line. Hence we can go to a particular line by just typing
the line number plus capital G.

    -   10G takes us to the beginning of line 10.

Now, we can combine this command with various verbs to for example delete or yank from current position to the
specified line. 
    -   d10G deletes the current cursor position till line 10 (end of it).
    -   y2G yanks from this position till line two (end of it). Note that this can be downward or upward.

This can be very useful when I want to delete something that's not part of a paragraph or etc.
