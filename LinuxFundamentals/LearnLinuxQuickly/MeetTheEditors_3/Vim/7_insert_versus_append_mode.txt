We can start typing in two modes: 
    -   append mode: By pressing 'a'
    -   insert mode: By pressing 'i'

What's the difference between the two modes?
    -   Pressing 'a' starts typing from the position after the cursor. Once we press escape, it jumps back a postition
        and waits there.
    -   Pressing 'i' does the reverse. It starts from the current position. Again, once we press escape it jumps back
        a position.

Note that another insertion mode happens with 'c', which stands for cut and insert. This mode depends on whether
it's mixed with 'w', '(', '{' or anthing else. The point is that the cursor remains where it is.
