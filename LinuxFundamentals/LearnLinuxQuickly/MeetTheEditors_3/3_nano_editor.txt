The nano text editor contains several shortcuts at the bottom of the page, all of which work with the ctrl and alt button 
(hence ^ is a shorthand for ctrl, and M is for alt):

Ctrl+O          Saves the current file (write out).

Ctrl+K          Cuts the current line and stores it in the buffer.

Ctrl+U          Pastes the line stored in the buffer (uncuts it!)

Ctrl+W          Searches for a string (word) in the file.

Ctrl+\          Replaces a string (word) in the file with another string.

Ctrl+R          Reads another file.

Ctrl+G          Views help information on how to use nano.

Ctrl+V          Moves to the next page.

Ctrl+Y          Moves to the previous page.

Ctrl+X          Exits the nano editor.

Alt+A           Highlights the text

Alt+6           Copies highlighted text
