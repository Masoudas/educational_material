All linux commands fall into the following four categories:

1- Executable program: These are written in C. cp is an example of such command
2- Alias: Basically a name for other (group of) commands
3- A shell builtin: The shell supports internal commands as well. The exit and cd commands are two examples of a shell builtin 
   command.
4- Shell functions: The sort of function we write in shell scripts, to achieve a particular goal.

To get the type of a command, we can write 'type command'. Note that 'type cp' shows that (perhaps all) executable commands are
found in the bin directory.

For example, for ls we get "ls --color=auto", which indiactes ls is an alias for the 'ls --color=auto'. Now we also see why we 
get a colorful output when we use this command.

Funny enough, if we write 'type type', we see that the type command itself is a shell bulletin.
