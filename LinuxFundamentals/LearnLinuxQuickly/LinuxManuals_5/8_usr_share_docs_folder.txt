The /usr/share/doc directory is another excellent place to look for help in Linux. This directory has very intensive documentation; 
it doesn't just show you how to use a command; sometimes, it will even show the name and contact information of the authors who 
developed the command. Moreover, it may also include a TODO file that contains a list of unfinished tasks/features; contributors 
usually check the TODO files to help fix bugs and develop new features.
