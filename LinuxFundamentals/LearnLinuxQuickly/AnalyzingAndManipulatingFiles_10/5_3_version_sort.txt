Consider the following table:
1	abc_1	Linux
3	abc_10	Mac
four	cde_11	RTOS
2	abc_2	Windows
Five	cde_1	RedHat

So here's some questions:
How can we sort based on the numeric values, so that abc_10 is below abc_1? Note that a sort with no option puts
abc_10 before abc_2 and even before abc_1:

$ sort -k 2 table
3	abc_10	Mac
1	abc_1	Linux
2	abc_2	Windows
four	cde_11	RTOS
five	cde_1	RedHat

Note that with a numeric sort, this problem disappears, and we get 10 after 2. Also notice that in both cases,
cde appears after abc.
$ sort -nk 2 table
1	abc_1	Linux
2	abc_2	Windows
3	abc_10	Mac
five	cde_1	RedHat
four	cde_11	RTOS
