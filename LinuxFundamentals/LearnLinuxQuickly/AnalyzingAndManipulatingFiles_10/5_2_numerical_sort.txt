What is numerical sort? I have no idea! In particular, in the following table:

abc10
cde2
abc2
cde1
cde0

A numerical sort and a sort with no option gives the same result! That is, they're like a normal sort for all
intents and purposes. That is, either of them sort as follows:

$ sort table # or $ sort -n table
abc10
abc2
cde0
cde1
cde2

What's different is sort -V, which actually compares versions as the manpage says. Hence, it will put abc2 
before. Notice that even version sort keeps the abc cde order. So, we can't purely sort based on numbers.
abc10, etc:
$ sort table
abc2
abc10
cde0
cde1
cde2

Another interesting option however is -h, which can sort human numeric values (like 1K and 2G.) So, I can sort
based on the size of files:

$ ls /usr | sort -hk 5 -	# Don't forget that we need to indicate which key (column) need to be sorted.

Finally, don't forget that we can sort based on months as well, using the -M.
