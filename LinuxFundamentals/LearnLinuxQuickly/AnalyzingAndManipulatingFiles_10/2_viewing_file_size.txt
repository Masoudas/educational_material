To get the disk usage of a file (i.e, size of the file) we can use the 'du' command, which of course stands for 
disk usage. The two options -b and -h show the size in bytes and humanly readable, respectively.

$ du -b file
$ du -h file dir

Note: Something that's of interest here is that if human readably print the file size, for even a two byte file
size I get:
4,0K	f.txt

Finally, note that this command is recursive:
$ du -h dir     # Prints the size of every file and subfolder in dir, including dir. dir would be last output
$ du -h dir/*   # Prints the disk usage of every file, including dir.
