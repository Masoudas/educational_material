To get the disk usage of a file (i.e, size of the file) we can use the 'du' command, which of course stands for 
disk usage. The two options -b and -h show the size in bytes and humanly readable, respectively.

$ du -b file
$ du -h file dir

Note: Something that's of interest here is that if human readably print the file size, for even a two byte file
size I get:
4,0K	f.txt

Finally, note that this command is recursive:
$ du -h dir     # Prints the size of every file and subfolder in dir, including dir. dir would be last output
$ du -h dir/*   # Prints the disk usage of every file, including dir.   

Note that du is recursie, and ig you type it on the root folder, it will show the space of all files there.
