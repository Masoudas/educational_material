Note that grep by default does not search for whole words. For example:

$ grep "txt" file

This command will fine txt, mytext or mytextmy. To search for only whole words, supply the -w option. Just as 
a reminder, this is independent of how we define the pattern. A word by default is something that's between two
spaces, or beginning of line to space, or from space to end of line. Hence, if I didn't want to use -w, I have to 
use a fairly complicated regex:

$ grep -w "txt" file
$ grep [$\s]txt[^\s]

An example with regular expressions:

$ grep -w "t[wo]o" file
