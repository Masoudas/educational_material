We can use the diff command to compare the contents of two files and highlight the differences between them (just
like the diff tool of git.)

A sample output of this command is as follows:

""""""""""""""""
10c10
< Pictures
---
> Pictures Difference.
14a15
> This is the different line.
""""""""""""""""

So, we can see that it says that in line 10 column, we have the given difference. Moreover, the second one says
that first one has 14 lines, while the second has 15, and the difference line is shown.

If the files completely differ from some point on, only the first difference line is indicated.
