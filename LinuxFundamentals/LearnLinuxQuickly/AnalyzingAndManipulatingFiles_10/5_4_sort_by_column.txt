We can use the -k option to sort based on columns, assuming there's a separator (or we can translate a csv like
file to have space.)

$ sort -k 1 file	# Sort based on column one

Hence, a more complicated version reads:
$ sort -Ckrn 1 file	# Check whether sorted using first column, reverse, and numeric.

We can specify which character group to use from a column as well. Say we wanted to sort based on chars 4 to 5
of column two. We'd go as follows (starting from 0:)

$ sort -k 2.3,2.4 file

To make sort's output xargs compatible, we can use the -z option, which terminates each line with a null char:
$ sort -z file | xargs -0
