- Transfer file from local to remote host:
   rsync {{path/to/local_file}} {{remote_host}}:{{path/to/remote_directory}}

One thing that I should always notice about such commands is that so long as I don't put a folder, files would
be copied
$ rsync file1 file2 folder  # The files are copied to this folder.

- Transfer file from remote host to local:
   rsync {{remote_host}}:{{path/to/remote_file}} {{path/to/local_directory}}

- Transfer a directory and all its children from a remote to local:
   rsync -r {{remote_host}}:{{path/to/remote_directory}} {{path/to/local_directory}}

- Transfer directory contents (but not the directory itself) from a remote to local:
   rsync -r {{remote_host}}:{{path/to/remote_directory}}/ {{path/to/local_directory}}
Me: Does the same task if we add * after, which I normally prefer.

Now, normally when we copy a file, its permission, owners, mod time and other characteristics may change. This 
means that the rsync cannot actually sync, because it thinks the two files are not the same. To remedy this,
we use the -a command to preserve every single property of the file. Moreover, we want to add the -z to compress
the data upon transfer. Moreover, we usually want to be verbose -v, and human readable -h, and see the progress
-P. therefore, we usually type (and also copy simlinks as they are, without changing them:)
rsync -azvhP {{path/to/local_file}} {{remote_host}}:{{path/to/remote_directory}}
