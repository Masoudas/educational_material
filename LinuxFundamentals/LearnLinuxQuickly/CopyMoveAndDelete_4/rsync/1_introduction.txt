The man pages of rsync say:
    rsync - a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool.
    It is famous for its delta-transfer  algorithm,  which  reduces the  amount  of  data  sent over the 
    network by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination.  
    Rsync is widely used for backups and  mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

And it has the following synopsis:
       Local:  rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [DEST]

       Access via remote shell:
         Pull: rsync [OPTION...] [USER@]HOST:SRC... [DEST]
         Push: rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [USER@]HOST:DEST

       Access via rsync daemon:
         Pull: rsync [OPTION...] [USER@]HOST::SRC... [DEST]
               rsync [OPTION...] rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/SRC... [DEST]
         Push: rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [USER@]HOST::DEST
               rsync [OPTION...] SRC... rsync://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/DEST

Therefor, aside from copying local files on the system, it can be used with secure shell to transfer files.
