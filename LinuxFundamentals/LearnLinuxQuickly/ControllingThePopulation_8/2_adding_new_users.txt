To add new user, we use the 'useradd -m user_name' command IN ROOT. This is because non-root users don't have the permission to
create users.

After adding the new user, we can use the tail command in the psswd file to see that the new user has indeed been added:

tom:x:1001:1001::/home/tom:/bin/sh

Note that in my case, the original user had UID and GID of 1000, but now, it's 1001 for the new user, so increments of one take
place.
