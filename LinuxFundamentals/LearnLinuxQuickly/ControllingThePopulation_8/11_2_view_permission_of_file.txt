We can view the permissions of a file by long listing the file. It will be the first field in the long list:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
- r w x r w x r - x

    (1) is the type of the file (d for directory, l for symbolic link and - for normal file)
    (2) user can read
    (3) user can write
    (4) user can execute
    (5) group ...
    (6) group ...
    (7) group ...
    (8) others ...
    (9) others can't write
    (10) others can't execute.

Note from me: The superuser supercedes all the permissions. It can read and write to, and execute any file on the 
system.
