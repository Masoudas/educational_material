Every user must belong to a primary group, which is used for login. They can also belong to a secondary (or supplementary) group as well. 

By default, whenever a new user is created, a group is also created with the same name as the user, and this group becomes the primary group of the new user.
This is the reason why for example if I created the first user on this computer as masoud, I'd see in /etc/group:

1            2   3       4
masoud:x:1000:masoud

This suggests that a user with encrypted passwd was made, with default gid of 1000, who belongs to the same group named masoud, which is used for log in.

To get all the ids of  a user, just punch in id. A sample output is shown below for a user named masoud:

uid=1000(masoud) gid=1000(masoud) groups=1000(masoud),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),120(lpadmin),131(lxd),132(sambashare),
888(developers)

It's interesting to note that:
    -   gid: indicates the PRIMARY group in this context, not the secondary group.
    -   uid=gid : This implies that this id is primary group, because it's the same as the user id.
    -   groups: This field shows the secondary groups this user belong to.

Note that the above discussion does not imply that when building a user, it has to be built with the same primary group name as its name. Indeed, we can
create another group called 'child' and set its primary group to masoud as follows:
useradd -m child --gid masoud
