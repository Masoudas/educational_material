In linux, every file has a set of permission for the following:
    - The owner of the file (user)
    - The group the owner belongs To
    - Everyone else (also referred to as others/world)

Each file has three sets of access:
    - Read
    - Write
    - Execute

The meaning of each of these access permissions is not the same for files and directories. 

    - Directories
        * Read: List content of the directory
        * Write: Be able to create and remove files INSIDE the directory
        * Execute: Be able to change the directory (move it, rename it, etc)

    - Files
        * Read: Read the file
        * Write: Write to the file
        * Execute: Execute the file (if executable)
