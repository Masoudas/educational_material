To change the permissions of a file, we can use the chmod command.

$ chmod o+w filename # Change the write permission of others to allow write.

Using the help option, we can see that we have the followng modes. Note that this is written in regex, meaning
zero or more of ugoa, then one or more of -+= etc. But then there's a | meaning or use -+= with 0 to 7.
Note that based on this, we can't say for example 'ug-wgx'.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
'[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'  
    # Note that a means all or everyone. 
    # = is used to explictly state the permissions


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Examples:
$ chmod og+x filename
$ chmod g=rwx filename  # Allow read, write and execute to the group.
$ chmod a= filename     # Gives zero permission
