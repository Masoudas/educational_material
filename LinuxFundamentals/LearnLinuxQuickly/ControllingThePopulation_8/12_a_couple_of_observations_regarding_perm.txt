So first note that if a folder has zero permissions, we can't execute it. However, if I list the folder that
it's part of, its properties will be shown!

$ mkdir f
$ chmod 000 f
$ ls -l f
error permision denied

$ ls -l
...
d---------  ... f


Moreover, if the parent folder has not enough permissions, I can't read the content of it. Hence, if a folder
inside has all the permissions, I can't access it through a parent folder that doesn't have enough permissions.

The permissions of what's created inside a folder however have nothing to do with the parent folder.

Something that I hadn't paid attention to so far! is that a non-owner even if it has all the permissions, is
unable to change the owner or permissions of a file. This is because they'd just be able to make themselves 
the owner, and set all the permisssions for themselves. This breaks down the entire permission system, and is
not allowed.
