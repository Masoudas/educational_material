WHAT IS A GROUP?

A group is a collection of users who share the same role or purpose.

All groups have their information stored in the file /etc/group. And just like with the /etc/passwd file, every line in /etc/group corresponds to exactly one group, 
and each line consists of 4 fields. For example, one of the most famous groups in Linux is the sudo group:

1       2  3    4
sudo:x:27:masoud
masoud:x:1000:

    1           This field stores the group name.
    2           This field usually has an X in it, which means the group password is encrypted and stored in the file /etc/gshadow.
    3           This field stores the GID (Group ID) number.
    4           This field stores the usernames of the group members.
