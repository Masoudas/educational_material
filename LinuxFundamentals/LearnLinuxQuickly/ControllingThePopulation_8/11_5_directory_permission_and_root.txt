Consider the /root folder. If we try to long list it from an ordinary user, permission would be denied. Why?
Because root is the owner of this folder, and does not give read permissions to anyone

$ ls -l /
drwx------   5 root root       4096 mars   8 12:39 root

Hence, we cannot read the content of this folder, write to it, and change its name, unless we're the root.
Note also as part of execution permission, a user cannot even cd even to this folder! So no ops that involve
the folder.

Now, note that no other user (including what I call the primary user such as masoudas) is not in the same group
as root (it's in sudoers, but that's another matter.) If we give the permission 701, it can now list it.

Now, the important point is this. Say I want to create a file inside this folder. I need both execution permission
(to run the folder with a command,) and write permission (to change its content.) Therefore, for example to use
the touch command, I need to first write chmod 703 and then make the file.
