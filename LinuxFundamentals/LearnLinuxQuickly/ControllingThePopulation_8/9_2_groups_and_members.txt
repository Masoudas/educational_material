We can get the groups a user is member of, using the groups command:

$ groups    # Prints the groups this user is member of.
$ groups $USERNAME # Same as above
$ groups another_user   # The groups another user is member of

Another question is, how can we get the members of a particular group? The usual famous way as we may recall is
to use the /etc/group file. There's also a command that's not installed by default, but can be used as well, 
called members:

$ members group_name
$ members sudo
