To add a user to a new user group, all we need to do is either add them at the point of creation, or add them using the usermod command,
The -a is very important here, as it APPENDS to the list of previous groups. Also, we use the '-G' to append secondary groups.

Example:
usermod -aG group_name user_name

Question: Can we just use -g and then write the group id? Note that this would set the primary group, not secondary (as we discuss next.) Hence, no!
