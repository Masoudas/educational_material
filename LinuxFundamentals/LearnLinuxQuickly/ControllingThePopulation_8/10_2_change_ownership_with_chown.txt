We can change the owner of a file using the 'chown' command. Notice that only the root can change the ownership.

$ sudo chown user:group file_name

We can change the user owner without changing the group owner by dropping the group name.

$ sudo chown user file_name

Or, we can change the group of a file without chaniging the owner as follows:

$ sudo chown :group filename

To change only the group owner of a file, we can use chgrp as the following example shows:

$ sudo chgrp group filename

To change the ownership of a file recursively, one can use the -R option:

$ sudo chown -R user:group filename
