Defining link and include paths is easy in Linux:

    - To define an include a path, just add -I paths. For example:
     'gcc -g main.cpp -o main  -I /usr/include /usr/local/include

    - To define search path for linker (where it would search for static or dynamic libraries), use the '-L' option.
      Usage option would be like that of the above.

As a reminder, the link libraries are put in the /lib folder. Whereas these have '.lib' in Windows, there's no
particular format associated with them in Linux. For example, openCV dynamic libraries are like 
libopencv-world.so.4.5.2.
