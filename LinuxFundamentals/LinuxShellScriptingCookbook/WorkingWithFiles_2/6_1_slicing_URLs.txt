As such, note that we can extract URLS from a website name, and by this I mean a repetitive application of such
operations:

URL=www.google.com:

$ echo ${URL%.*} # Remove rightmost .*
www.google

Or:
$ domain_and_protocol=${URL%.*}; domain=${domain_and_protocol%.*}

$ echo ${URL%%.*} # Remove right to leftmost  .* (Greedy operator)
www

$ echo ${URL#*.} # Remove leftmost  part before *.
google.com

$ echo ${URL##*.} # Remove left to rightmost  part before *.
(Greedy operator) com
