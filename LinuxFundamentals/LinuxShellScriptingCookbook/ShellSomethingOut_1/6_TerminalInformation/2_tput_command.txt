well as getting information about it's appearance. 

$ tput lines    # How many lines the terminal (screen) contains (changing screen size changes this value)
$ tput cols     # How many columns the terminal (screen) contains ( ... )

$ tput cup  10  10  # Position cursor (meaning beginning of username@hos_name) at row 10, col 10
