We have the following three uses of quotes:

    * Double quote ("):   Variables are expanded when enclosed in double quotes
    * Single quote ('):   Variables within single quotes are not expanded
    * Backward quote (`): Commands within backward quotes are executed and their output substituted into that 
                          location
        
Consider the following example:
$ var=`expr 2 + 2`
$ echo "$var"
