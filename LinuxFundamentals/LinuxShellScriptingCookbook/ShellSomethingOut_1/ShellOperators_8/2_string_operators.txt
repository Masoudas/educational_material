Imagine variable 'a' contains "abc" and variable 'b' contains "cde". Then, we can compare the two strings using
the following operators:

    -   Equality        :   [ $a = $b ]
    -   Inequality      :   [ $a != $b ]
    -   Nonempty        :   [ $a ]  # Checks if the variable is non-empty
    -   Non-zero        :   [ -n $a ]   # Checks variable length is non-zero
    -   Zero            :   [ -z $a ]   # Checks variable length is zero
