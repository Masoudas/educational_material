The structure is:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
for variable in condition
do
    ..
done
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Note that if we bring do to the for line, we need to terminate the loop statement with ; (just like we do with
a an if then loop:)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
for variable in condition; do
    ..
end
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
