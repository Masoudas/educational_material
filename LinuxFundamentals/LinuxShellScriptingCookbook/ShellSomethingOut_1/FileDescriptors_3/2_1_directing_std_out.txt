Use the > to direct stdout to a file and override the file. Use >> to append to the file.

echo "Streaming to a file" > f
echo "Appending to a file" >> f

Append a 2 to > or >> to direct stderr to a file.

ls + 2> error_file
ls - 2>> error_file

Of course, we can stream both outputs to a file
ls + 2>> error_file 1>>f

And the famous command to redirect stderr to stdout.
ls . 1>all 2>&1

Notice that famously, writing 2>1 means write everything to file 1. Using &1 implies get a reference to output
1.

We can alternatively write:
command 2>&1 alloutput.txt

Or:
cmd &> output.txt
