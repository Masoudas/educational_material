Alternately, we can use /dev/stdin as the output filename to use stdin.Similarly, use /dev/stderr for standard 
error and /dev/stdout for standard output. These are special device files that correspond to stdin, stderr, and 
stdout.


The redirection operators (> and >>) send output to a file instead of the terminal. The > and >> operators 
behave slightly differently. Both redirect output to a file, but the single greater-than symbol (>) empties 
the file and then writes to it, whereas the double greater-than symbol (>>) adds the output to the end of the 
existing file.

By default, the redirection operates on standard output. To explicitly take a specific file descriptor, you must 
prefix the descriptor number to the operator.

The > operator is equivalent to 1> and similarly it applies for >> (equivalent to 1>>).

When working with errors, the stderr output is dumped to the /dev/null file. The ./dev/null file is a special 
device file where any data received by the file is discarded. The null device is often known as a black hole, 
as all the data that goes into it is lost forever.
