When a command exits because of an error, it returns a nonzero exit status. The command returns zero when it 
terminates after successful completion. The return status is available in the special variable $? (run echo 
$? immediately after the command execution statement to print the exit status).

$ ls +
...
$ echo $?
2

$ ls 
$ echo $?
0

Finally, after all these years, I undestand why we return from int main!
