We can create an alias for a command using the command alias:

$ alias alias_name="command_string" 

$ alias install='sudo apt-get install'

Notice that like variables, aliases are defined per shell instance. Think before reading the following line,
but how do we make sure that our aliases are present in each new shell instance, without having to retype the
aliases every single time?

Answer: Using the .bashrc file. We can in fact stream our command to .bashrc directly:

$ echo 'alias alias_name="command sequence"' >> ~/.bashrc
