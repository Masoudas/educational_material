We can remove aliases in two obvious ways:

    -   Use "unalias alias_name"
    -   Set alias to empty, "alias alias_name="

The difference between the above two is that with the latter, alias_name still remains as a command, though
it does nothing. After executing the former, the bash returns a command not found error.

Alternatively, we can remove the command from .bashrc, using for example stream editor:

$ sed -i "/alias line/" ~/.bashrc

Or we can use grep:
$ grep -v alias_name ~/.bashrc > temp && mv temp ~/.bashrc  # We can't read and write from a file at the same
                                                            # time!

Or we can use awk:
gawk -i inplace '!/alias_name/' myfile.txt
