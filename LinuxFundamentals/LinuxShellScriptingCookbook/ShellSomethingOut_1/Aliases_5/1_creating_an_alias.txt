We can create an alias for a command using the command alias:

$ alias alias_name="command command_string" # The phrase command cab be present or not!

$ alias install='sudo apt-get install'

Notice that like variables, aliases are defined per shell instance. Think before reading the following line,
but how do we make them present in the shell upon each execution?

Answer: Using the .bashrc file. We can in fact stream our command to .bashrc directly:

$ echo 'alias alias_name="command sequence"' >> ~/.bashrc
