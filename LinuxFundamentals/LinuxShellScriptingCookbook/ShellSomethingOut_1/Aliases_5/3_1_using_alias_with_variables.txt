So, an alias for a command that accepts arguments can access the arguments using $. Hence, we can use those
arguments, and expand them for example. 

The following example aliases the rm command, so that whenever we remove a file, it will go to the backup
folder, before being totally eliminated.

$ alias rm="cp $@ ~/backup && rm $@'
