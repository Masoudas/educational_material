Me: Note that variable indexing (meaning those that are passed to shell) start from 1. The zeroeth variable is
actually the name passed to execute this script (be it the name passed to bash command, or the path used to
execute this script directly without the help of the bash command:)

%%%%%
# script
echo $0
echo $1

%%%%%

$ ./script 1
./script
1

$ bash script 1
script
1

Anoter useful operation is the $@, which means all variables passed to the shell script.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#!/bin/bash
echo "variables passed are $@"
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

$ script 1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
