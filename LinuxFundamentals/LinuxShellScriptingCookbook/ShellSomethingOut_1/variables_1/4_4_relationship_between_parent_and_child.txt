Where as variables are passed from parent to child process, it's not possible to pass variables from child to
parent process. In other words, whatever we do inside a shellscript will remain inside the shellscript, or is
passed to the processes that run as children of it. But nothing is reflected on the outside.

As a more concrete example, consider the following simple script

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#!/bin/bash
GREP_OPTIONS=-v

export GREP_OPTIONS     # Now, this variable is passed to every grep command we run here.
grep "export" $0    # Print the reverse of every instance of export in this file!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now consider running this script:
$ script 
#!/bin/bash
GREP_OPTIONS=-v

$ echo $GREP_OPTIONS    # Prints nothing

Note that the GREP_OPTIONS prints nothing, because GREP_OPTIONS is only valid inside the shell script, and because
we exported it, to all processes that are run inside this script. On the other hand, in the parent process, which
is the pseude-terminal that ran this, we can't see this variable.
