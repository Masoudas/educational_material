When an interactive shell starts, it executes a set of commands to initialize settings, such as the prompt 
text, colors, and so on. These commands are read from a shell script at ~/.bashrc (or ~/.bash_profile for 
login shells), located in the home directory of the user. The Bash shell maintains a history of commands 
run by the user in the ~/.bash_history file.


A login shell is created when you log in to a machine. However, terminal sessions you create while logged in 
to a graphical environment (such as GNOME, KDE, and so on), are not login shells. (Me: I think the virtual
terminal shells that we create by pressing alt+ctrl+f are an example of login shells.)
