So as we may recall, one famous way of writing a piece of text to a file is to use the echo command in the
script:

#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a generated file. Do not edit. Changes will be overwritten." > file

As it turns out, we can do the same task, using the cat command in the following bizzare fashion:

#!/bin/bash
cat<<EOF>log.txt
This is a generated file. Do not edit. Changes will be overwritten.
EOF

$ cat log.txt
This is a generated file. Do not edit. Changes will be overwritten.
