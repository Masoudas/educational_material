The following is taken from 'man bash', section 'CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS':

Conditional  expressions  are  used  by the [[ compound command and the test and [ builtin commands to test file 
attributes and perform string and arithmetic comparisons. The test abd [ commands determine their behavior based 
on the number of  arguments;  see  the  descriptions  of those commands for any other command-specific actions.

Expressions are formed from the following unary or binary primaries (me: the ones I list later). Bash handles 
several filenames specially when they are used in expressions.  If the operating system on which bash is running 
provides these special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate them internally  with  this  behavior: 
If any file argument to one of the primaries is of the form /dev/fd/n, then file descriptor n is checked. If
the  file  argument  to  one  of  the  primaries  is one of /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, or /dev/stderr, file 
descriptor 0, 1, or 2,  respectively, is checked.

Unless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow symbolic links and operate on the target of the 
link, rather than the link itself.
When  used  with [[, the < and > operators sort lexicographically using the current locale.  The test command sorts 
using ASCII ordering (me: Both of which are the same for an 8 bit char set. Note that this is the reason why we
better use [[ for string comparisons rather than <.)
