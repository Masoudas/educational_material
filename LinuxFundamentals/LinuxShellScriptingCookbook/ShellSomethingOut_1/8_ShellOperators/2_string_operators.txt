Imagine variable 'a' contains "abc" and variable 'b' contains "cde". Then, we can compare the two strings using
the following operators:

    -   Equality        :   [ $a = $b ] OR [[ $a = $b ]] OR [[ $a == $b ]]
    -   Inequality      :   [ $a != $b ]
    -   Nonempty        :   [ $a ]  # Checks if the variable is non-empty
    -   Non-zero        :   [ -n $a ]   # Checks variable length is non-zero
    -   Zero            :   [ -z $a ]   # Checks variable length is zero
    -   Comparison      :   [ $a < $b ]     # Compares ASCII values. Hence, A < a and AAA < AAa
                                            # This is equivalent to C++ lexicographical comparison
                            [ $a > $b ]                                     

It's been suggested to use double bracket for string comparison as opposed to single bracket, which lessens the
possibility of error.

if [[ $a == $b ]] && [[ $b == $c ]]
