To prepend to shell variables, we need to expand the current variable content right after what we prepend:

$ var=Prepended_Value:$var  # Puts a colon after the addition
$ var=Prepended_Value;$var  # Puts a semicolon after the addition.

Example:
$ PATH=/opt/myapp/bin:/usr/bin:/bin 
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/myapp/lib:/usr/lib;/lib

Of course, it's up to us whether we want to export these variables or not.
