Environment variables are inherited from the parent processes. For example, HTTP_PROXY is an environment 
variable that defines which proxy server to use for an Internet connection as follows:

HTTP_PROXY=192.168.1.23:3128
export HTTP_PROXY

The export command declares one or more variables that will be inherited by child tasks. After variables are 
exported, any application executed from the current shell script, receives this variable. There are many 
standard environment variables created and used by the shell, and we can export our own variables.

For example, the PATH variable lists the folders, which the shell will search for an application. A typical 
PATH variable will contain the following:

$ echo $PATH 
/home/slynux/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

Directory paths are delimited by the : character. Usually, $PATH is defined in /etc/environment, /etc/profile 
or ~/.bashrc

To add a new path to the PATH environment, use the following command:
PATH=$PATH:new_path

Reminder note:
When using single quotes, variables will not be expanded and will be displayed as it is. This means, 
$ echo '$var' will display $var.

Whereas, $ echo "$var" will display the value of the $var variable if it is defined, or nothing if it is not 
defined.
