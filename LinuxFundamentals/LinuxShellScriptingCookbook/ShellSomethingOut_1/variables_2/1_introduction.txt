All programming languages use variables to retain data for later use or modification. Unlike compiled 
languages, most scripting languages do not require a type declaration before a variable is created. The type 
is determined by usage. The value of a variable is accessed by preceding the variable name with a dollar 
sign. The shell defines several variables it uses for configuration and information like available printers, 
search paths, and so on. These are called environment variables.

Variables are named as a sequence of letters, numbers, and underscores with no whitespace. Common 
conventions are to use UPPER_CASE for environment variables and camelCase or lower_case for variables used 
within a script.
