To print all of the current environment variable, use either of the following (these include those that are
defined in the .bashrc file):

$ env
$ printenv

To view the variables of other processes, chech their environment variables in the /proc/$PID/environ
folder:

$ cat /proc/$PID/environ

To get the process id of an application on this username:
$ ps --user $(id - u) | grep process_name       # Method 1
$ pgrep process_name    # Method 2: Use process grep

Note that the containing files have variables terminated in '\0'. Use the translate command to translate
them into \n (it asks whether to show a binary file. Say yes):

$ less /proc/$PID/environ | tr '\0' '\n'

Some of the well-known environment variables are HOME, PWD, USER, UID, and SHELL, HOSTNAME, USERNAME, ...
