To see the difference between the content of the env and print env file, one has to do the following famous 
piping:

$ env > 1
$ printenv | diff 1 -   # Send the result of the previous command.

Note that we can't use the famous $(), as this will return the first line of the env as a result, which is
not what we seek (indeed, the $() returns the result of the command, for example $(ls) returns 0 or 1.)
