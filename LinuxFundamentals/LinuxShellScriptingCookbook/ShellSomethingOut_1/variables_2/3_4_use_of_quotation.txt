What is the difference between the following expressions?

my="Has Space and; semicolon"

var1=${my}
var2="${my}"
var3=\"${my}\"

The first and second expressions are similar, and they result in var1 and var2 to be set to the content of 
my. The white space or semicolon have no effect here.

The third one keeps " as part of the variable.
