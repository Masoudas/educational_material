Me: Note that variable indexing (meaning those that are passed to shell) start from 1. The zeroeth variable is
actually the name passed to execute this script (be it to bash, or execute it directly:)

%%%%%
# script
echo $0
echo $1

%%%%%

$ ./script 1
./script
1

$ bash script
script
1

Anoter useful operation is the $@, which means all variables passed to the shell script.

#!/bin/bash
echo "variables passed are $@"
