The id of the super user is always 0. Now, we can check this by:
    [1] logging in as super user and then "$id -u"
    [2] echoing the $UID variable, which contains the userid of the current user

In fact, here's a sample script that checks whether the current user is the super user:

if [ $UID -ne 0]; then
    echo Not super user, exiting
    exit
else
    echo super user
fi

Or equivalently

if $UID -ne 0:1
    echo Not super user, exiting
    exit
else
    echo super user
fi

Note that [ is actually a command and must be separated from the rest of the string with spaces.
