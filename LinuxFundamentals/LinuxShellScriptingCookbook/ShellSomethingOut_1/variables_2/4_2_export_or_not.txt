Me: Note a very important distinction between using and not using export.

When we use export, all the child processes of this shell will be using this variable (like a bash script
for example.) However, if we didn't do that, and just defined a variable, then they wouldn't inherit it.

You can check this as follows:

$ v1=a
$ export v1

$ v2=b

Now, typing these two in a bash script:

$ echo -e "$v1\t$v2"

will just print v1 and empty for v2 (me: Again, like CMake, we print empty for empty variables!)

As a final reminder, note that each time a new shell is opened, the .bashrc is executed before it. Hence,
if we have a variable exported, it will be automatically exported to each terminal everytime we open a new
terminal (using alt+ctrl+t.) At the same time, I don't think every background process would have it, and 
those use the environment files.
