Shell scripts can be created same as shell, that is, with an equal sign:

$ myVar=value

The name of the variable is varName and value is the value to be assigned to it. If value does not contain 
any space character (such as space), it need not be enclosed in quotes, otherwise it must be enclosed in 
single or double quotes.

Note: Consider the difference between the two, and remember not to make this mistake!
varName=value   # defines a new variable name
varName = value # Checks for equality of the two!

Access the contents of a variable by prefixing the variable name with a dollar sign ($).
var="value" #Assign "value" to var
echo $var
echo ${var} # The CMake version!

Variable values within double quotes can be used with printf, echo, and other shell commands, but then
again, not with single quotes:
fruit=Apple
number=5
echo "The $fruit tree has ${number} ${fruit}s"

Note that because the shell uses a space to delimit words, we need to add curly braces to let the shell know 
that the variable name is fruit, not fruits.
