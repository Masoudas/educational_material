In most implementations, true is actually a binary, which is under the bin folder:
$ find /bin/ -name true

So, we can avoid calling true which would require opening a subprocess and thus increasing the required time of
our package by using the ':' (do nothing) command. Why does it work? do nothing returns zero, and apparently
what the while condition works with without the [] is the return value of the script. In fact. I think they
ONLY work with return values, and [] for example actually returns 0 or 1 based on the conditions. Ok, now I
understand how && and || work as well.

repeat(){
	while :
	do 
	   $@ && return || sleep 30
	done
}
