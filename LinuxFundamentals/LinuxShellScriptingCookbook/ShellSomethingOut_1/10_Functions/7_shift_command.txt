Most applications accept arguments in different formats. Suppose -p and -v are the options available, and -k N is 
another option that takes a number. Also, the command requires a filename as argument. This application can be 
executed in multiple ways:

$ command -p -v -k 1 file
$ command -pv -k 1 file
$ command -vpk 1 file
$ command file -pvk 1

Within a script, the command-line arguments can be accessed by their position in the command line. The first 
argument will be $1, the second $2, and so on.This script will display the first three command line arguments:

echo $1 $2 $3

However, we prefer to shift each argument to the first argument and then process them that way. The command shift
will do that for us:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
for i in `seq 1 $#` 
do
	echo "Argument $i is $1"
	shift
done

echo "Just showing that actuall arguments WILL shift after this: $2"
