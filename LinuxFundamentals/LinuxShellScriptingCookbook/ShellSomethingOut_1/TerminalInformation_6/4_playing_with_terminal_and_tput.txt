Imagine we're printing something to the terminal, and then we want to clear the terminal output and print on
the same line. How do we go about that?

The answer is in using the tput command.
The gnu documentation says "The tput command allows shell scripts to do things like clear the screen, 
underline text, and center text no matter how wide the screen is. To do these things, it translates the 
terminal-independent name of a terminal capability into its actual value for the terminal type being used."

It apparently connects to some database.

There are several thousand options, but the ones that are most widely used are:
    -    sc      Save cursor position
    -    rc      Restore cursor to position of last `sc'
    -    ed      Clear to end of display (*)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#!/bin/bash
tput sc # Save position of line, which is the new line position
echo "This line is printed ..."

sleep 1

tput rc # Go back to previous position
tput ed # Clear till the end of display

echo "Now, a new line is printed in the same place"
