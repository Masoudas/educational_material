Producing time intervals is essential when writing monitoring scripts that execute in a loop. The following 
examples show how to generate time delays:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#!/bin/bash 
#Filename: sleep.sh 

echo Count: 
tput sc 

# Loop for 40 seconds 
for count in `seq 0 40`     # Alternatively, {1..40..1}
do 
  tput rc 
  tput ed 
  echo -n $count    # Why not go to next line? Because the position of the cursor would change. Although
                    # This is fine I guess, because sc has the original position.
  sleep 1 
done
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
