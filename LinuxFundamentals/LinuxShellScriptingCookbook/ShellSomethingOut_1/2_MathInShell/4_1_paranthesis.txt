Paranthesis can also be used like brackets for math operations:

result=$(( no1 + 50 ))

The paranthesis is very interesting, because we can do many operations like bit shift, defining hex or binary
values, binary ops, etc:

$ and=$((0xFF & (0x01<<1)))	# Don't forget that this is a variable declaration :D
$ or=$((010 | 07))	# Octal or, result is 15.

Note: $[] is also used for numeric calculations in the shell as well.
