eval as we may recall computes the command from a string, which is useful for forming commands from strings.

$ folder=.
$ eval "ls ${folder}"   # Equivalen to "ls ${folder}"

One thing to note about the eval command is that single quotation is not escaped as part of a string. Hence,
it can be used to escape characters:

$ eval "ls '$'1"    # ls the first argument. '' Does not appear in final evaluation. Everything inside of it
                    # is kept as is.
