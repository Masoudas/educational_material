Apparently, the debug output is sent to stderr instead of stdout. We can then redirect it as such, particularly
if it's part of 'set -x' and 'set +x' error:

$ ./script_that_has_set_x 2> debug.txt

From Bash 4, there's a variable called BASH_XTRACEFD which determines which stream is used bash debugging.
We can then use this one to set our debugging stream.

$ exec 6> debug.txt
$ BASH_XTRACEFD=6
$ ./script_that_has_set_x
