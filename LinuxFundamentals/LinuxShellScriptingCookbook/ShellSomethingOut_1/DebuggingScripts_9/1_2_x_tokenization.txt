So when we want to debug a script, we can set +x or -x around a porition of the code we want to debug, to
debug only that porition and end.

    *   -x  Start debugging
    *   +x  End debugging

for i in {1..6}; 
    do 
        set -x 
        echo $i 
        set +x 
    done 
echo "Script executed"

We can do the same thing with -v and +v options:
    -   set -v: This displays input when they are read
    -   set +v: This disables printing input
