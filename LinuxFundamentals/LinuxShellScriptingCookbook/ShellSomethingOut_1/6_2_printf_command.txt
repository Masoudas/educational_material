printf is the same as the corresponding C command and can be used as follows:

#!/bin/bash
#Filename: printf.sh

printf  "%-5s %-10s %-4s\n" No Name  Mark
printf  "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 1 Sarath 80,3456      # Notice that the numbers have comma rathen than dot.
printf  "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 2 James 90,9989
printf  "%-5s %-10s %-4.2f\n" 3 Jeff 77,564

The %s, %c, %d, and %f characters are format substitution characters, which define how the following argument 
will be printed. The %-5s string defines a string substitution with left alignment (- represents left 
alignment) and a 5 character width. If - was not specified, the string would have been aligned to the right. 
The width specifies the number of characters reserved for the string. For Name, the width reserved is 10. 
Hence, any name will reside within the 10-character width reserved for it and the rest of the line will be 
filled with spaces up to 10 characters total.

For floating point numbers, we can pass additional parameters to round off the decimal places. For the Mark 
section, we have formatted the string as %-4.2f, where .2 specifies rounding off to two decimal places. Note 
that for every line of the format string, a newline (\n) is issued
