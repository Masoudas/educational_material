Just like a normal script, a function has an exit status, which can be read with $?. Note that inside a shell,
we use return, but inside a script we use exit. Note that the exit status of a function does not affect the exit
status of a script.

%%%%%%%%
function () { return 1 }

function
echo "Status was $?"
