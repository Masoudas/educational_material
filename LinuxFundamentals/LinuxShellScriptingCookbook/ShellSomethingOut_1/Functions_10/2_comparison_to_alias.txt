Functions and aliases appear similar at a casual glance, but behave slightly differently. The big difference 
is that function arguments can be used anywhere within the body of the function, while an alias simply appends 
arguments to the end of the command. This is fairly trivial, so don't be baffled by the following example!

Consider for example:
$ alias lsg='ls | grep' 
$ lsg txt 
   file1.txt 
   file2.txt 
   file3.txt

Now, imagine we wanted to get the inet address. So, if we aliased the grep together with ifconfig as follows,
it won't work. Because we need to pass eth0 after ifconfig, and not grep!

$ alias wontWork='ifconfig | grep'
$ wontWork eth0
eth0  Link  encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:11::22::33::44:55

However, if we defined a function, we could put the variable everywhere:
$ getIP() { ifconfig $1 | grep 'inet; }
$ getIp eth0
