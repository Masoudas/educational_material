Internally, dates are stored as an integer number of seconds since 00:00:00 1970-01-01. This is called epoch or 
Unix time.

To get the epoch time, use the +%s flag with date:

$ data +%s

Note also that we can convert a particular time stamp into epoch time:
$ date --date "Wed mar 15 08:09:16 EDT 2017" +%s
