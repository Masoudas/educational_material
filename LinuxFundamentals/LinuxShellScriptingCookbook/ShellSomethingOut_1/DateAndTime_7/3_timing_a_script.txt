The data granularity is in seconds. We can use it then to benchmark a script. That being said, the proper way
of doing so is to use 'time':

#!/bin/bash
#Filename: time_take.sh
start=$(date +%s)
commands;
statements;
end=$(date +%s)
difference=$(( end - start))
echo Time taken to execute commands is $difference seconds.
