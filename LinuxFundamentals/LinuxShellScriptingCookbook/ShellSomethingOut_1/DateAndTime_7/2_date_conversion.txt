We can for example convert a particular date to a format we want, to get for example the weekday that day 
corresponds to using the date command:

Note that when creating a format for data, the first placeholder always requires a +, even inside a string.

$ date --date "Jan 20 2001" +%A     # Get this particular date and print, but print only the COMPLETE weekday
$ date --date "May 9 1990" +%a      # Short for weekday
$ date --date "May 9 1990" "+%a %B" 
$ data "+%H:%M:%S"

We have the following placement chars:

Weekday             %a (for example, Sat)
                    %A (for example, Saturday)

Month               %b (for example, Nov)
                    %B (for example, November)

Day                 %d (for example, 31)

Date in format (mm/dd/yy) %D (for example, 10/18/10)

Year                %y (for example, 10)
                    %Y (for example, 2010)

Hour                %I or %H (For example, 08)

Minute              %M (for example, 33)

Second              %S (for example, 10)

Nano second         %N (for example, 695208515)

Epoch Unix time in seconds  %s (for example, 1290049486)
