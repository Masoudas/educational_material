I feel the need to demonstrate this point once again. Note that a user needs execution permission to execute
a BINARY. We don't need to have access to the internals of a binary (read it.) We just need execution perms.

However, with shell scripts, the shell actually need to read the shell script. Now, because the owner of a
pseudo shell is the current user (for example masoud, and this can be verified by long listing the /dev/pts
folder,) then, because we need to load the content of the shell script, we need read access first. Then,
of course we need to execute it. Hence, chmod 755 allows other users to execute the script with the ./script
command.

Technically, however, we only need the read permission. This is because we can read the content into another
file, and then execute that other file! Or we can use "bash myscript" as discussed to directl execute it.
