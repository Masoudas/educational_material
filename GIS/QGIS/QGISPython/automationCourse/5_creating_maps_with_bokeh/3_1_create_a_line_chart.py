The basic idea of Bokeh is a two-step process: First, you select from Bokeh’s building blocks to create your visualization. Second, you customize these building blocks to fit your needs.

To do that, Bokeh combines two elements:
    -   A Python library for defining the content and interactive functionalities of your visualization.
    -   A JavaScript library called BokehJS that is working in the background to display your interactive visualizations in a web browsers

Based on your Python code, Bokeh automatically generates all the necessary JavaScript and HTML code for you. In its default setting, Bokeh automatically loads any additional JavaScript code from Bokeh’s CDN (content delivery network).
