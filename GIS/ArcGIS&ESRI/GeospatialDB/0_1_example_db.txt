Here's an example of a GIS database that we took from Khorasan's power distribution company (call it GIS.gdb, which essentially was a geospatial database that ends in gdb).

We want to discuss what the following tables contain:

# Metadata of the geospatial database.
GDB_ColumnRegistry
GDB_ItemRelationshipTypes
GDB_ItemRelationships
GDB_ItemTypes
GDB_Items
GDB_Layers
GDB_Locators
GDB_Metadata
GDB_ReplicaLog
GDB_RowidGenerators
GDB_ServiceItems
GDB_TableRegistry
GDB_TablesModified
GDB_Tables_Last_Modified
GDB_Version

# The actual layers that we defined
lyr_a_meter
lyr_auto_booster
lyr_auto_switch
...
lyr_v_meter

# Indexers, which are like the normal indexers in normal databases.
sqlite_sequence
st_aux_spatial_reference_systems
st_geometry_columns
st_spatial_reference_systems
...
st_vtspindex_interface
