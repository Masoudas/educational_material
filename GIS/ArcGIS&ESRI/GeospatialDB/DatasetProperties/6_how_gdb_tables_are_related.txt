The best way to see how the system tables that track geodatabase functionality work together is to examine them using SQL. Select all rows and columns from the GDB_Items table to see its contents.

The values in the Type column are stored as UUIDs, which are related to the UUID column in the GDB_ItemTypes table. Therefore, you can return the item type for each item using a SQL query similar to the following:

SELECT gdb_items.UUID, gdb_itemtypes.name AS "Type", gdb_items.name
   FROM gdb_items INNER JOIN gdb_itemtypes
   ON gdb_items.type = gdb_itemtypes.UUID;

UUID	                                Type	            Name

Similarly, the GDB_ItemRelationships table contains UUIDs that are key values from other tables. Each relationship contains two of the UUID values seen in the GDB_Items table above: one for the relationship's destination item and one for its origin item. To resolve these to human-readable strings, you must join the GDB_ItemRelationships table to the GDB_Items table twice. To see the relationship type, include a join with the GDB_ItemRelationshipTypes table, as shown in the following SQL examples:

--SQL Server and PostgreSQL query
SELECT reltypes.name AS type,
   origin_items.name AS "Origin Name", dest_items.name AS "Dest Name"
FROM gdb_items AS origin_items,
   gdb_itemrelationships AS relationships,
   gdb_items AS dest_items,
   gdb_itemrelationshiptypes AS reltypes
WHERE
   origin_items.UUID = relationships.originid AND
   dest_items.UUID = relationships.destid AND
   relationships.type = reltypes.UUID;
