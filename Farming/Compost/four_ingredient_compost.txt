We need four ingredients:
	-	Green material (Nitrogen)
		Kitchen scraps of any kind, vegetables, banans, egg shells are very good, preferably no meat or bones,
		leaves or anything else, grass clips.
	-	Brown material (Carbon)
		Paper (news paper,) cardboard, saw dust is very good, dried leaves. Don't compost anything glossy. Cut
		the brown stuff in small pieces.
	-	Water
	-	Air

Compost on the ground, on a ground that has worms. Mix everything fifty fifty, and add water. Melange and mix
once every week. It takes (allegdly) a couple of weeks to form the compost. Put things on top of each other in
layers. Add some dust too it too, or old compost. Keep adding more stuff as you move forward. It's done in two
months (in the conditions I saw.) Turn frequently, especially in the beginning. Some say six to eight months.
