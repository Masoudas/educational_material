Bash does not support native regular expressions like some other standard programming languages. The Bash shell 
feature that is used for matching or expanding specific types of patterns is called globbing. Globbing is mainly 
used to match filenames or searching for content in a file (although for the latter, we use grep, technically.)

Recall the famous uses of glob:
	-	Star
Means zero or one char.
$ ls *.txt	# Apparently, expanded here to all files that end in txt in this folder, and then listed.

	-	Question mark
Means one character. 
$ ls ???.txt	# Expands to all files with three chars that are text.

	-	Famous bracket chars:
Some examples include [:digit:], [:alpha:], [:alnum:], [:upper:], [:lower:], or for example [a-q] or [W-Z].
Note that these can be combined with *, but it's not like a regular expression. Consider the examples below:
$ ls [0-9]	# Find all files that are only one char from this set.
$ ls [0-9]*.txt	# Start with this char, then have zero or more of any other char (not necessarily 0-9,)
$ ls [0-9][:alnum:]	# Of course
