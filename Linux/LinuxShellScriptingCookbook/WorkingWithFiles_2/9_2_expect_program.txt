'expect' is a bizzare bizzare program, used for interacting with shell scripting automatically! To use this package,
we need to install the expect package:

$ sudo apt-get install expect.

'expect' is based on the TCL language. We'll discuss the spawn, expect, and send commands for simple automation. With 
the power of the TCL language behind it, expect can do much more complex tasks. See more about the TCL language at 
the www.tcl.tk website.

The three major commands are:
	-	spawn	Runs the new target application.
	-	expect	Watches for a pattern to be sent by the target application.
	-	send	Sends a string to the target application.

Consider the script we talked about in the previous example. We can now interact with it based on a pattern that 
may be printed on stdout (such as "folder" or "file" as part of it,) and then write the following script to interact
with it:

%%%%%%%%
#!/usr/bin/expect  
#Filename: automate_expect.tcl 
spawn ./backup .sh  
expect { 
  "*folder*" { 
     send "notes\n" 	# Notice the \n
     exp_continue 
   } 
  "*type*" { 
     send "docx\n" 
     exp_continue 
  } 
} 
%%%%%%%
And as such, when the patterns appear, the script interacts with them.
