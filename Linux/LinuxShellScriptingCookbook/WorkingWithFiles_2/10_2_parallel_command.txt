The parallel command is a tool that usually does not come as a package and needs to be installed, but is good for
making enough processes parallel.

Note: Apparently, parallel only works with file names, but I think it works with stdout rather!

The syntax of this command is pretty much like exec of find, which means we have a replacement {} for the result
of the previous command. Consider for example:

ls *.txt | parallel grep "pattern" {}

Here's another example of using this command. Notice that {.} means file name without the extension. Also note that
convert is a command from ImageMagic's suite.
ls *jpg | parallel convert {} -geometry 50x50 {.}Small.jpg
