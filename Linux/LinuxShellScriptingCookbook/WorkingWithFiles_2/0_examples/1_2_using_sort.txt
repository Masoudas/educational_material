Assuming we can pay the price for sort, we can sort the two files, and then compare them using diff. The
return value of diff would be 0 if they're the same, and 1 if different, and 2 if there's trouble.

Another problem with this approach is that at least from my point of view, we have to create a temp file.

%%%%%%%
#!/bin/bash

cp $1 /var/f1
cp $2 /var/f2

sort /var/f1
sort /var/f2

diff /var/f1 /var/f2

# This portion is not necessary, as we return the return value of the last function.
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then	
	exit 1
fi
exit 0;
