In this script, I wanted to compare two files to see if one is contained in another or not. So what I did
is to first the number of lines in the two files and return if they're not equal. Then, I read the first 
file (all of it) and used grep to see if it exists in the second file.

You could argue that a better approach is to read the file line by line, but I'm not sure that it would 
actually be faster that way.

#!/bin/bash

len1=$(wc -l $1)
len2=$(wc -l $2)

if [ len1 -ne len2 ]; then
	exit 1
fi

for line in `cat $1`
do 
	grep $line $2

	if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then 
		exit 1
	fi
done 

exit 0;
