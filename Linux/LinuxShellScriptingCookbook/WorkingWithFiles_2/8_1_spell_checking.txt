If we checkout inside the /usr/share/dict, we find that there are a number of dictionaries in there:

$ ls /usr/share/dict
american-english	british-english	cracklib-small	README.select-wordlist	words	words.pre-dictionaries-common

We can use these to check for the spell of any word. Consider this script:

#!/bin/bash 
#Filename: checkword.sh 
word=$1 
grep "^$1$" /usr/share/dict/british-english -q  
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then 
  echo $word is a dictionary word; 
else 
  echo $word is not a dictionary word; 
fi 

Then, we can see that:
$ ./checkword.sh ful 
ful is not a dictionary word 

$ ./checkword.sh fool 
fool is a dictionary word
