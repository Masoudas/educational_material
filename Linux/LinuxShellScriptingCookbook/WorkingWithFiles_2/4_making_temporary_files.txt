As we already know, the best place for temporary files is in the /tmp folder, as it's cleaned up after reboot.
Now, aside from being able to create a file there using the touch command, we can use the mktemp command to
create such a file. Note that maketemp chooses the file name for us, and we can use shell interpolation ops to
just get the file name back as follows:

$ filename=`mktemp`
$ echo $filename

And to make a temporary folder, use the -d option:

$ dirname=`mktemp -d`
$ echo $dirname

We can just generate a file name with this command as well:

$ name=`mktemp -u`
$ echo $name

Finally, we can supply a pattern name, so that name is done according to the pattern. However, with patterns,
files are created in place, and not in temp:
$ filename=`mktemp test.XXX'
test.cUM
test.IMR

AS we can see, which ever file that's created has XXX as part of its name, and then XXX is replaced by something 
random.
