Consider the following command:

$ cd /var/log
$ find . -exec sh -c 'echo -n {} | tr -d "[:alnum:]_.\-" | tr "/" " "; basename {}' \;

So, we find whatever is in this folder apparently, then using a sh example, we execute the following command
as string: First, echo the file or folder name you've found, then using translate, delete any alpha numeric,
_, ., \, or -, Then, translate each / into space. Finally, print the base name of the same file, using the 
basename command.

So for example, if we use this command on the log folder, we get:
mail
  statistics
gdm
  ::0.log
  ::0.log.1
cups
      error_log
      access_log
  ... access_l
