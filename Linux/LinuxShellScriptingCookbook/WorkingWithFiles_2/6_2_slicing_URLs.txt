As such, note that we can extract URLS from a website name, and by this I mean a repetitive application of such
operations:

URL=www.google.com:

$ echo ${URL%.*} # Remove rightmost .*
www.google

Or:
$ domain_and_protocol=${URL%.*}; domain=${domain_and_protocol%.*}

$ echo ${URL%%.*} # Remove right to leftmost  .* (Greedy operator)
www

$ echo ${URL#*.} # Remove leftmost  part before *.
google.com

$ echo ${URL##*.} # Remove left to rightmost  part before *.
(Greedy operator) com

Question: How would you determine the domain name if you were given the following address?
URL=www.google.com/index/page.php

Well, we can use grep to just get the part before slash:
$ echo $URL | grep "^[a-zA-Z0-9.]+"		# The dot is actually important, and is a literal dot
www.google.com
