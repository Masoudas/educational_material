As opposed to calculating the checksum of a file, the idea behind encryption is, well, encryption. A tool that's
commonly used is gpg. tldr reveals the following versions:

- Encrypt doc.txt with only a passphrase (output to doc.txt.gpg):
   gpg --symmetric {{doc.txt}}	# Or equivalently, with -c.

- Decrypt doc.txt.gpg (output to stdout):
   gpg --decrypt {{doc.txt.gpg}}

- Encrypt doc.txt for alice@example.com (output to doc.txt.gpg):
   gpg --encrypt --recipient {{alice@example.com}} {{doc.txt}}

 
Another command used is base64, which is essentially the same as gpg:
- Encode the contents of a file as base64 and write the result to stdout:
   base64 {{filename}}

- Encode from stdin:
   {{somecommand}} | base64
