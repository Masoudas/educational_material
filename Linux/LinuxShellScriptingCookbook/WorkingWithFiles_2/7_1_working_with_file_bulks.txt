Frequently, we need to work with a mass of files. We can use as an example a combination of a for loop and find

In the following example, we find every jpg or png file and then name them from 1 as "image-1.jpg" or 
"image-1.png"

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#!/bin/bash 
#Filename: rename.sh 
#Desc: Rename jpg and png files 

count=1; 
for img in `find . -maxdepth 1 -iname '*.png' -o -iname '*.jpg' -type f ` 	# The use of iname is unnecessary!
do 
  new="image-$count.${img##*.}" 	# Forming an string for the filename

  echo "Renaming $img to $new" 
  mv "$img" "$new" 
  let count++ 

done
