The Bash shell performs basic arithmetic operations using the let, (( )), and [] commands. The expr and bc 
utilities are used to perform advanced operations.

Note that a numeric value is assigned to a variable the same way strings are assigned. The value will be 
treated as a number by the methods that access it:

#!/bin/bash
no1=4;
no2=5;

Now, there are three ways to do math in shell:
	-	Using $(()) command
	-	Using let command
	-	Using bc <<< '( )'
