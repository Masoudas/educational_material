bc is a command line calculator. We can go to the interactive mode by typing the following command:

$ bc -l

Now, we can do many calculations including floating point math. However, one thing that interests us is the input
base and the output base. These two can be defined as obase and ibase. So imagine we're inside the interactive
mode, type the following:

$ bc -l
! ibase=10	# Set input base to 10
! obase=2	# Set output base to 2
! 2 + 2		# Result of this summation?
100

Now, of course, we generally like to use this command as a single command inside the shell. We need then to do two
things, one is to define an output direction, and second is to pass commands as strings to bc with comma separation.
Therefore:

$ bc <<< "obase=2; 2 + 2" 
100
