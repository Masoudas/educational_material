We can use bracket in pretty much the same way as let (me: except that to ensure that it's not confused with
condition, we need to prefix it with $)

#!/bin/bash
no1=1
no2=2

result=$[ no1 + no2 ]   # Always mind the space between brackets.

We can also use the interpolation notion inside brackets with no problem:

result=$[ $no1 + 5 ]
