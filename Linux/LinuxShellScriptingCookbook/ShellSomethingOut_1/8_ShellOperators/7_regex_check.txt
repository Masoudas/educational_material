Say I wanted to check whether a string contains a certain regular expression. I'd simply use the echo grep pipe:

$ echo $var | grep REG_EX && ...

Or:

$ if  echo $var | grep REG_EX ;  then ...

Another useful expression is the =~, which is simply compare with a regular expression:
$ [[ $var =~ REG_EX ]] && echo "true" || echo "false"

I've also seen that we can directly compare with glob expressions:
$ [[ $var = *'.'* ]] && echo true || echo false
