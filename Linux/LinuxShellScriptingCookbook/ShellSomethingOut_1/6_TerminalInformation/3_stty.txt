Allows some additional setting on the terminal. Famously, if we have an script in which we want the user to
put in their password, but not echo it on the command line, we can do as follows:

#!/bin/bash

#!/bin/sh
#Filename: password.sh

echo -e "Enter password: "

# disable echo before reading password
stty -echo
read password

# re-enable echo
stty echo

echo
echo Password read.
