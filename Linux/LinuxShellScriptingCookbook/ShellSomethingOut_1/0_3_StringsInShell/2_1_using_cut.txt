Using cut, we can easily tokenize a string, which is simpler than what we discussed before.

In particular, the -d option defines the delimiter, and then -f defines which field to use:

$ echo "my,brave,face" | cut -d',' -f1,3	# First and third field.

We can also cut a set of chars

$ cut -c 1-16 [files]
