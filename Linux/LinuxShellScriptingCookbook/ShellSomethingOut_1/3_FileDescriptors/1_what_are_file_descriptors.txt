File descriptors are integers associated with the input and output streams. The best-known file descriptors are 
stdin, stdout, and stderr. The contents of one stream can be redirected to another. 

As we discussed, when we use the < >, we're redirecting the input output streams from keyboard or screen from
or to files, respectively.

Note that:
    -   0   :   stdin
    -   1   :   stdout
    -   2   :   stderr
