Associative arrays have been introduced since version 4.0 of bash.

Note: Get the bash version using bash --version command.

To declare associate arrays, whose keys for example could be website names, use delare -A:

#!/bin/bash
$ declare -A ass_array	# ass stands for associative of course!
$ ass_array["ass_key"]="ass_val"
$ ass_array["key_ass]="key_ass"

$ echo ${ass_array[key_ass]}    # Don't forget that everything goes inside {}

Note that, alternatively, we can define key value pairs as a chunck when declaring arrays:
$ declare -A ass_array=([index1]=val1 [index2]=val2)

Or, we can use this notation to add to the array later on:
$ declare -A ass_array
$ ass_array=([index1]=val1 [index2]=val2)

Note: Don't drop the declare part, otherwise the above would be a totally different thing!
