Use paranthesis to define an array. Indexes start from 0.

$ arr=(val1 val2 val3)

Note that we can directly define the array as well:

#!/bin/bash
arr[0]="val1"
arr[1]="val2"
arr[2]="val3"


Use [] notation to access elements.

$ echo ${arr[0]}        

Note that $arr[0] is actually a syntax error. The pointer increment has to go inside interpolation. However,
funny enough:

$ echo $arr[0]  # Prints val1[0] :D

Use the famous @ to read all entries directly:
$ echo ${arr[@]}    # Equivalently, echo ${array_var[*]}
val1 val2 val3

We can also print the number of elements, using a combination of # and @:
$ echo ${#arr[@]}

Also, note that ${#arr} gives the total length of array in chars. Hence, an array like "a b" has in fact three chars.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The second approach to filling an array is by using the += operand together with the initialization (), like so:
$ arr=(); arr+=(v1); arr+=("v2" "v3")

The good thing about this method is that we don't have to index the elements with [], and the array is filled 
naturally.
