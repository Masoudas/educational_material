To write a single line comment in a shell script, we can use the pound sign.

There's no clear cut way to write multi-line comments in a shell script. Instead, what we can do is to use the
stream operator without anything to stream to. Moreover, we need a string token to determine the boundary of the
comments. An example is shown below:

<<comment
This is the first line of my command.
This is the second line.
comment
