Command substitution or $() allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. Command substitution 
occurs when a command is enclosed as follows:

$ $(command)    # Like openning a new command line, and then returning its result to this line

This is equivalent to the `` then:
$ `command`

$ var=$(expr 2 + 2)
$ var1=`expr 2 + 2`
