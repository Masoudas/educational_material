The function: :(){ :|:& };: spawns processes forever and ends up in a denial-of-service attack. The & character is 
postfixed with the function call to bring the subprocess into the background. This dangerous code forks processes 
forever and is called a fork bomb.

You may find it difficult to interpret the preceding code. Refer to the Wikipedia page 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb for more details and interpretation of the fork bomb.Prevent this attack by
restricting the maximum number of processes that can be spawned by defining the nproc value in 
/etc/security/limits.conf.

This line will limit all users to 100 processes:
