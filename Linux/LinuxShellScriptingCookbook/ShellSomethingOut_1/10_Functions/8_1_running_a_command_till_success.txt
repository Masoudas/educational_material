Sometimes, we want to run a command till it succeeds. An interesting suggestion is the followin:

repeat(){
	while true
	do
		$@ && return
	done
}

repeat() { while true; do $@ && return; done }	# One liner equivalent.

What it does is quite genious and very clear of course.

We can also add a delay so that we wait for a certain amount time:

repeat() { while true; $@ && return || sleep 30; done }	# Recall that short-circuit or short-circuits if other
							# side is true.
