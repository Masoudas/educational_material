PS stands for Prompt Statement. These variables determine how the shell interacts with us, the most important
of which we're aware of is PS1, which is what's shown on every new line.

The variables associated are:
    -   PS1: The default interactive prompt on Linux (on pseudo terminals of course.)
    -   PS2: The interactive prompt for a multi-line command
    -   PS3: The prompt for the select loop inside a shell script
    -   PS4: The prompt that gets displayed, when we execute a shell script in debug mode
    -   COMMAND_PROMPT: Bash shell executes the content of the PROMPT_COMMAND just before displaying the PS1 
        variable (meaning by the time execution of a command ends)

Note: I personally think one should not export these variables, but rather set them in the .bashrc file. Make
of that what you will though.
