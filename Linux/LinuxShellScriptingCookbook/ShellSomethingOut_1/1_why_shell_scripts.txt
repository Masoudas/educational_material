When Bell Labs created an interactive user interface for the brand new Unix operating system, it had a 
unique feature. It could read and evaluate the same commands from a text file (called a shell script), as it 
accepted being typed on a terminal.

This facility was a huge leap forward in productivity. Instead of typing several commands to perform a set 
of operations, programmers could save the commands in a file and run them later with just a few keystrokes. 
Not only does a shell script save time, it also documents what you did.

Initially, Unix supported one interactive shell, written by Stephen Bourne, and named it the Bourne Shell 
(sh).

In 1989, Brian Fox of the GNU Project took features from many user interfaces and created a new shellâ€”the 
Bourne Again Shell (bash). The bash shell understands all of the Bourne shell constructs and adds features 
from csh, ksh, and others.

Users interact with the shell environment via a terminal session. If you are running a GUI-based system, 
this will be a terminal window. If you are running with no GUI, (a production server or ssh session), you 
will see the shell prompt as soon as you log in.
