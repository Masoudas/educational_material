The first kind is 

for item in $var
do
//...
done

Note that in this construction, the IFS is very important, and determines where the next item starts and current
ends. Hence, we can change it from any kind of space to ',' or ';', etc.

There's also the following two versions:
for i in {1..10}
for i in `seq 1 10`

And finally, we have the standard for loop, which is written with two paranthesis:
for((i=0;i<=10;++i))
