Commands are typed and executed in a terminal session. When a terminal is opened, a prompt is displayed. The 
prompt can be configured in many ways, but frequently resembles this:

%%%%
username@hostname$
%%%%

Alternatively, it can also be configured as root@hostname # or simply as $ or #. The $ character represents 
regular users and # represents the administrative user root. Root is the most privileged user in a Linux system.
