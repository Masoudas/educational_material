Read can read only n chars, and at the same time print a message before reading the input. The former is done with
the 'n' option, while the latter is done with p. The good thing is that read snaps the command line as soon as
that number of chars are pressed, and does not wait for more chars:

$ read -p "Please enter something. Or don't. whateves!\n" -n 2 var
