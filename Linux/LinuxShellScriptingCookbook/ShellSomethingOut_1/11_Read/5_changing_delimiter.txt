We can change the delimiter for read from '\n' to anything else with the -d option". The delimiter of course is
not included.

$ read -d ' ' var

Question: What's the effect of changing Internal Field Separator (IFS) variable on read? Well, there doesn't 
seem to be any effect. However, say I change the IFS to 'a' instead of default space. Then, it would print 
space in place of a when I echo:

$ IFS=a
$ read x
mama

$ echo $x
m m
