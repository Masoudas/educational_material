Read command is used for interactively getting an input from the keyboard or standard in and putting it inside
a variable.

Most input libraries in any programming language read the input from the keyboard and terminate the string when 
return is pressed. There are certain situations when return cannot be pressed and string termination is done based 
on a number of characters received (perhaps a single character). For example, in an interactive game, a ball is 
moved upward when + is pressed. Pressing + and then pressing return to acknowledge the + press is not efficient.
