To generate a file of a particular size, use the dd command with a source:

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=junk.data bs=1M count=1

If the input parameter (if) is not specified, it will read the input from stdin by default. Similarly, if 
the output parameter (of) is not specified, it will use stdout as the default output sink.

Question: What's written inside the file? The device file generates '\0'. But of course, if we write this
we'll get nothing inside the file. Essentially, what is generated is a binary file. So, we can hexdump it
to see it's content. In any case, the file that's created is not a utf8 or ascii file.

Notice that the dd command can also be used to measure the speed of memory operations by transferring a 
large quantity of data and checking the command output (for example, 1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 
0.00767266 s, 137 MB/s as seen in the previous example).
