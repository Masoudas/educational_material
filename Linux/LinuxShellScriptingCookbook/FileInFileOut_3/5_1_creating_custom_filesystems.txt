When we create and allocate space to a file, that space can be used to mount our own (even custom) file system.

Consider the following example:
$ dd if=/dev/random /of=~/loopbackfile.img fs=1GiB count=1
$ mkfs.ext4 ~/loopbackfile.img

Now, we mount this file system just like a normal file system:
$ mkdir ~/loopback
$ mount -o ~/loopbackfile.img ~/loopback	# The o option is used to mount loopback file systems.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We can define a device file for our loopback image with the losetup command:
$ losetup /dev/loop100 ~/loopbackfile.img

As such, we can mount our device directly:
$ mount /dev/loop100 ~/loopback

We can also unmount using the path Or the device file:
$ umount /dev/loop100 
$ umount ~/loopback
