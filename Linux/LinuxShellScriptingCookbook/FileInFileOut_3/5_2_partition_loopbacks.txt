After creating our loopback file systems and loading them using losetup, we can partition it using fdisck.

$ losetup /dev/loopback1 ~/loopsystem
$ cfdisk /dev/loopback1

To create a device for our newly created partition, we pass the offset flag -o with the number of bytes:
# losetup -o 32256 /dev/loop2 loopback.img

Then, we can like always mount our new device:
# sudo mount /dev/loop2 Path
