It occures to me that just using the awk portion of the code, we can get the duplicates. That is, we can compare
each file with the previous entry and if they're the same, we add one of them as the duplicate of the other.

As such, we only need the awk portion of the code. Then, we use xargs to convert all lines into a single row, and
then pass those to the rm command. Nice and easy!

ls -lS --time-style=long-iso | awk '
    BEGIN {
		getline; getline;
		name1=$8; size1=$5;        
    }
    {
		name2=$8; size2=$5;			
		if (size2 == size1){
			cmd1 = "md5sum " name1;	cmd2 = "md5sum " name2;
			cmd1 | getline; hash1=$1;	cmd2 | getline; hash2=$1;
			close(cmd1);	close(cmd2);
			if (hash1==hash2){
				print name2;
			}
		}
		name1=name2; size1=size2;
    }
	' | xargs rm
