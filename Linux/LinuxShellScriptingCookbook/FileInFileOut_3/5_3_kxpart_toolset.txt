The kpartx is tool for easily mounting all the devices inside the loopback system. kpartx is not usually installed
and we have to do it manually.

Note that what kpartx does it that it creates the device files for our partitions.

$ kpartx -v -a diskimage.img 
add map loop0p1 (252:0): 0 114688 linear /dev/loop0 8192
add map loop0p2 (252:1): 0 15628288 linear /dev/loop0 122880

Then, we can mount the devices:
$ mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 /mnt/disk1

$ kpartx -d diskimage.img 
loop deleted : /dev/loop0
