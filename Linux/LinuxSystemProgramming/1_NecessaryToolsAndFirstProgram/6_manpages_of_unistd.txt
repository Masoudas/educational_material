So apparently, there's a manpage associated with unistd, which oddly enough can't be found on the manpages of
mu Ubuntu machine. In either case, we read about this header:

    -   unistd.h â€” standard symbolic constants and types
The <unistd.h> header defines miscellaneous symbolic constants and types, and declares miscellaneous functions. 
The actual values of the constants are unspecified except as shown.

Some examples of the fields contained are:
    _POSIX_VERSION
    int          setuid(uid_t);
    etc ...

I also would like to remind that this header is in the /usr/include/ folder (and not in the x86_64_gnu ones!)
