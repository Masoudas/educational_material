Note that when compiling with gcc, a simple

$ gcc file.c

Generates the assembly output named a.out. Because this is the assembly output, we can just execute it then.
On the other hand:

$ gcc -c file.c

ME: Compiles this file, but does not link it. Note that even without any explicit includes, the simplest 
program requires linkeage to system libs for exit and what not, so we have to always pass it through linker.
