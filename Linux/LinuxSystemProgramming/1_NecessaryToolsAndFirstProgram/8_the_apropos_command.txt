As we may recall, the apropos command searches inside the man pages for the keyword we have provided. If we
wanted to confine the search to a particular section of the man pages, we can pass the "-s" option:

$ apropos -s 3 getopt

To search for two keywords, use the and option:

$ apropos -a directory remove

An of course, we can combine the options:

$ apropos -s 3 -a directory remove
