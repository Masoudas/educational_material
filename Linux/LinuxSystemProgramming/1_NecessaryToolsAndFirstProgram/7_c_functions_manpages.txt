If we consider a function like printf, we know that it can be used in shell. Hence, typing:

$ man printf

would actually bring the manpage of printf (section 1).

To actually get the c function from the headers, we need to refer to section 3 of man pages:

$ man 3 printf

Or for example, for the uplink function, we can type:

$ man 2 unlink

for example, to get the manpage for the getop function we just used, we can type:

$ man 3 getopt

And we can see that it returns -1 when there are no more options to parse.
