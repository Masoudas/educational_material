To add this service to our current daemons, we need to reload all unit files, which can be done as follows:

$ systemctl daemon-reload	# Reloading all unit files.
...

And now, we can check on the status of our newly loaded service:

$ systemctl status my-daemon
‚óè my-daemon.service - A small daemon for testing
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/my-daemon.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)

Question: Why does it say our daemon is inactive, even though we're sure it's loggin right now?
Disabled means that it won't start automatically when the system boots. Inactive means that it hasn't started yet.

What happens after we activate the daemon? Well, just like we expect it, it will become part of the systemd child
process. We can in fact check this as follows:

$ cat /var/run/my-daemon.pid   # Or pgrep my-daemon
$ pstree -Asp $(cat /var/run/my-daemon.pid)
systemd(1)---my-daemon-v2(5136)
