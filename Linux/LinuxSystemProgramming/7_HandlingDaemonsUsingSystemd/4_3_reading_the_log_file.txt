Now, just like printk in kernel programming, the logging occurs in the systemd logging journal, as opposed to our
normal command line. To verify this, we can do as follows and check the instant updating of the journal:

$ journalctl -u my-daemon -f	# f is seeing the updates, and u is for passing the daemon name.

A note: Note that if we type the above command without sudo, it will say that only users who are in the and I quote
"Users in groups 'adm', 'systemd-journal' " can see the journal without having to be sudo. So, we could add 
ourselves to those groups. Let's recall that:

$ cat /etc/group
...
systemd-journal:x:101:
...

So, in order to add ourselves to this group, we need to use the usermod command:
$ usermod -a -G adm systemd-journal

Allegedly, we should see the jouranlctl fields as such without having to be superuser.
