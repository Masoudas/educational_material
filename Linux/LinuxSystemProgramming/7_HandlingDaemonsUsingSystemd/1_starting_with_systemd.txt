By typing systemd, we can see all active UNITS currently running on the system. 

Historically, Linux has been managed with several smaller pieces. For example, init was the first process on the 
system, which started other processes and daemons to bring up the system. System daemons were handled by shell 
scripts, also called init scripts. Logging was done either by the daemon itself via files or syslog. Networking 
was also handled by multiple scripts (and still is in some Linux distributions).

Nowadays, though, the entire system is handled by systemd. For example, the first process on the system is now 
systemd (which we have seen in previous chapters). Daemons are handled by something called unit files, which create 
a unified way of controlling daemons on the system. Logging is handled by journald, systemd's logging daemon. But 
do note that syslog is still used by many daemons to do extra logging. 

If we type in systemctl, we can see the list of active daemon (units). 

All the services we saw in the previous step reside as unit files in /lib/systemd/system or /etc/systemd/system. 
Navigate to those directories and look around at the files. These are all typical unit files. Installed packages
will be installed in /lib/systemd/system. So-called local unit files are placed in /etc/systemd/system. Local unit 
files mean unit files specific to this system, for example, modified by the administrator or manually added for 
some program.

As we said, the journaling daemon of systemctl is journalctl. We must use this program to see the loggin activity
of systemctl. Press G to go to the end of the journal entry.
