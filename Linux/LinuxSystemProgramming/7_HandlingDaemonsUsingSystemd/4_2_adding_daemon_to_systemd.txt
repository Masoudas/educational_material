Now, if we run the previous program normally from the command line, we get a normal printing program that executes
certain functions when we pass on signals.

How do we add this as a systemd daemon? The answer is that we slightly change the unit file, and define the type
of the unit file from forking to simple. This would be like below:

"""""""""""""""
[Unit]	
Description=A small daemon for testing
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/my-daemon-v2
Restart=on-failure
Type=simple
PIDFile=/var/run/my-daemon.pid
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
"""""""""""""""

Then, we can go ahead and reload the daemon files (which is important, because we've changed the content of a
daemon,) 

$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl start my-daemon
