It's also possible to have a daemon that's dependent on network, meaning it would start as soon as the there's a
network connection:

""""""""""""" my-daemon.service
[Unit]
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target
[Service]
...
"""""""""""""

There is also another dependency statement you can use, called Requires.

The difference between After, Wants and Requires is that After specifies the order of the units. A unit with After 
will wait to start after the unit required is started. Wants and Requires, however, only specify the dependency, 
not the ordering. With Wants, a unit will still start even if the other unit required isn't started successfully. 
But with Requires, the unit will fail to start if the required unit isn't started.

In 'man systemd.unit' is a lot of information about the different sections of a unit file and which directives we 
can use in each section.
