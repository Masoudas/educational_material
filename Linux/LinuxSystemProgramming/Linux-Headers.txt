Where are the headers?
Some are in /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu. Others are in the actual /usr/include. sys headers are in
/usr/include/sys. They're scattered is what I'm ready to say.


	-	unistd.h
Contains standard symbolic constants and types in Linux, such as mod_t (file mode,) _POSIX_VERSION, functions for getting
uid, pid, etc, setsid, setuid, fchown, etc. Many of the standard tasks of Linux are done using this header file.

	-	sys
The sys header contains information that can be extracted about the underlying machine, like RAM, n-Cores, etc.  
man pages are syscalls.
	--	sys/types.h
	The types used be the sys functions.
	--	sys/stat
	The stat of a file (except for link info, which is in unistd.)

	-	linux
Contains a series of subheaders related to the current linux system:
	--	linux/limits.h
	Limits on many Linux related entities, like PATH_MAX, etc

	-	fcntl.h
file control options. Functions like 'creat' for making a file, or open for establishing a relationship between a file and
file descriptor, ...

	-	errno.h
Contains errno variable and the associated error macros (like EACCESS, etc.) 

	-	utime.h
See man 7 utime.h. Used for access and changing modification and access time.

	-	signal.h
The header that contains signal management information.
