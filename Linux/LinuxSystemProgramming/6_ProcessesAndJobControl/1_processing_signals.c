/**
 * The intend of this program is to process various signals differently, including the kill signal, or stop
 * signal.
 * 
 * Because processing signals is not C99, we strictly specifu the POSIX version in the following code.
 * 
 * The header that contains the signal processing methods is signal.h In it, there exists the macros that correspond
 * to signal values. To register an action with a signal, we use the sigaction method, whose signature is:

int sigaction(int sig, const struct sigaction *restrict act, struct sigaction *restrict oact);

 * the first parameter is signal. The second parameter is the actions to be taken on receipt of the signal. The
 * third is used to copy the action previosuly associated with the signal.
 * 
 * The sigaction structure has the following structure:

Type:					Name		Description:
void(*) (int)	***	sa_handler	***	Pointer to a signal-catching function or one of the macros SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL.
sigset_t		***	sa_mask		***	Additional set of signals to be blocked during execution of signal-catching function.
int				***	sa_flags	***	Special flags to affect behavior of signal.
void(*) (int, siginfo_t *, void *))  *** sa_sigaction  *** Pointer to a signal-catching function. â”‚
      
 * Now, below we've created simple handlers. Note that sa_mask below is set to all functions! This implies that all
 * other signals will be ignored when our particular signal is being handled! T do so, we use the function called
 * sigfillset. Then, we set sa_flags to SA_RESTART, meaning any interrupted systemcall will be restarted (jeez!).
 * As such, we can set a handler for our signal. Notice that we never set the sa_sigaction parameter.
 * 
 * To use this code, send the process to background, and then send signals to it:
 
$ ./prog &
$ kill -USRSIG1 PID_NUMBER
Received USR2 signal
