PGID stands for Process Group ID and is a way for the system to group processes. The PGID for the child process is 
the PID of the parent process. In other words, this PGID was created to group the parent and child process since 
they belong together. The system sets the PGID to the PID of the parent who created the group. We don't need to 
create these groups ourselves; that is something the system does for us.

SID stands for Session ID, and this is also a way for the system to group processes. However, a SID group is 
usually bigger and contains more processesâ€” often a whole "session," hence the name. For example, the SID could be
the PID of the Bash shell. The same rules apply here; the SID number will be the same as the PID of the process 
that started the session. This session consists of the user's shell and all the programs that start from it. That 
way, the system can kill all the processes that belong to that session if we log off for example.

So let's say we want to create a process that would live independently of a terminal (session.) One of the things
that we need to do then is to change the session id, so that it would not be killed by that terminal disappearing
(or that session for that matter.) We discuss this next.
