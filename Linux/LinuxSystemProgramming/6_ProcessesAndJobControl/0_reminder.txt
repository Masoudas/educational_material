Recall that every process on the Linux system has started it's existence by being forked from another process.

Me: Indeed, when we start a new thread in C++ for example, we're doing the same thing as well.

Also note that the parent of all processes (that is, systemd) has PID=1.

As a final reminder, recall that signals are sent to the program via the kill program. So we can list them using
$ kill -l
and then send whichever one we desire to our program.
