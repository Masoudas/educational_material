/**
 * An orphan is a child whose parent has died. However, as we have learned in this chapter, every process needs a 
 * parent process. So, even orphans need a parent process. To solve this dilemma, every orphan gets inherited by 
 * systemd, which is the first process on the systemâ€”PID 1.
 * 
 * A side note is that systemd in my Linux distro actually creates a subprocess and then that subprocess inherits
 * this orphan.
 * 
 * Don't forget that to see the parent and status of this process, we can also use:
 
$ ps jp 13894
