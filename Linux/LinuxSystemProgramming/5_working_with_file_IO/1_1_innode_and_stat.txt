As we may recall, a file is simply a cover for innode of a particular file, where the innode points to the
exact location of a file in memory (the inode number). More over several files may point to the same
Inode (memory location) with hard links. On the other hand, we may have several shortcuts to the same
file, or soft-links, whose innode would be a copy-paste of the original file (does not add to number of
links.). Symbolic linkness appears as file name, and type of the file. (Me: although oddly enough,
I found out that the number of blocks is not the same for a soft link stat compared to the original file.)
