/**
 * The purpose of this program is to get an option -c from the user. If this option is present, we simply skip
 * any errors we might encounter when reading (that is, facing non digit chars.) Otherwise, we return an error.
 * 
 * Note that we passed two arguments to the printHelp() function. The first argument is a FILE pointer. We use 
 * this to pass stderr or stdout to the function. Stdout and stderr are streams, which can be reached via their 
 * FILE pointer. This way, we can choose if the help message should be printed to stdout (in case the user asked 
 * for the help) or to stderr (in case there was an error).
 * 
 * We could have written the program to do all the steps for us, such as filter out the values from the text file, 
 * do the conversions, and then write the result to a new file. But that's an anti-pattern in Linux and Unix. 
 * Instead, we want to write small tools that do one thing onlyâ€”and do it well. That way, the program can be used 
 * on other files with a different structure, or for a completely different purpose. We could even grab the data 
 * straight from a device or modem if we wanted to and pipe it into our program. The tools for extracting the 
 * correct fields from the file (or device) have already been created; there's no need to reinvent the wheel.
