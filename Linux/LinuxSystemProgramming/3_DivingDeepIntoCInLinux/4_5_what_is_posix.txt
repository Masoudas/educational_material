POSIX is a set of standards specified by IEEE. The purpose of the standard is to have a common programming 
interface among all POSIX operating systems (most Unix and Unix-like systems). If you only use POSIX functions and 
POSIX header files in your program, it will be compatible with all other Unix and Unix-like systems out there. The 
actual implementation can differ from system to system, but the overall functions should be the same.
