When we 'df -h', we see a couple of weird partitions as follows:

    -   /dev/loopN       56M   56M     0 100% /snap/c    where N=0,...
dev/loopX are virtual devices to mount image files, these are -read only- so do not get larger or smaller than 
they are when created.


    -   ramfs or tmpfs (See Master Embedded Linux Program, chapter two as well)
tmpfs is a temporary file storage paradigm implemented in many Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to 
appear as a mounted file system, but data is stored in volatile memory instead of a persistent storage device. 
A similar construction is a RAM disk, which appears as a virtual disk drive and hosts a disk file system. 

Me: Recall that a volatile memory like RAM can store data as long as there's power.

Everything stored in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be directly created on non-volatile 
storage such as a hard drive (although swap space is used as backing store in case of low memory situations). 
On reboot, everything in tmpfs will be lost. 

The memory used by tmpfs grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains.
Many Unix distributions enable and use tmpfs by default for the /tmp branch of the file system or for shared 
memory (me: though in my Ubuntu20, they're mounted on /dev/shm, /run/user, etc)

Note that in a listing, we have more than a number of tmpfs:
Filesystem               Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/centos-root   50G  3.6G   47G   8% /
devtmpfs                 3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev
tmpfs                    3.9G  148K  3.9G   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs                    3.9G  9.1M  3.9G   1% /run
tmpfs                    3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sda6                494M  159M  336M  33% /boot
/dev/mapper/centos-home   73G   62M   73G   1% /home
tmpfs                    782M   32K  782M   1% /run/user/1000

This is because sections of RAM are shared between various purposes (like for example /dev/shm stands for
shared memory used by all programs.) The OS is responsible for managing these shared RAMs.

    -   udev
Another RAM partition. Apparently, tmpfs is normally restricted to 50% of RAM, and udev to another 50. As we can
see, it's associated with the /dev folder in a "df -h" meaning that it's related to devices, and therefore, an
essential part of the OS. unmounting it causes a system crash.
