Note that fdisk commands only create PARTITIONS. To actually make a file system, we need to use the mkfs, in which
case the partition would be mountable.

The mkfs (or make file system) command as the manpages say "is used to build a Linux filesystem on a device, 
usually a hard disk partition.  The device argument is either the device name (e.g. /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb2), or a 
regular file that shall contain the filesystem. The size argument is the number of blocks to be used for the 
filesystem.

The exit code returned by mkfs is 0 on success and 1 on failure.        

In actuality, mkfs is simply a front-end for the various filesystem builders (mkfs.fstype) available under Linux.   
The filesystem-specific builder is searched for via your PATH environment setting only."

Essentially, mkfs is used for formatting the disk partition. If we want to build a filesystem (i.e, format) the
partition, we need to first umount the device, which the command would alarm us about if don't do so.
