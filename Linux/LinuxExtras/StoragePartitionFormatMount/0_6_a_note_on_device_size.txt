This is taken from MasteringLinuxEmbeddedProgramming:

Although a microSD card has 8 GB printed on the outside, it was only 7.2 GB on the inside. In part, this is 
because of the different units used. The advertised capacity is measured in Gigabytes, 10^9, but the sizes 
reported by software are in Gibibytes, 2^30. Gigabytes are abbreviated GB, Gibibytes as GiB. The same applies 
for KB and KiB, and MB and MiB. 

In simple plain English, one measures in powers of two (in computer,) the vendor measures in powers of ten
(in scientific units.)
