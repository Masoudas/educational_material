Here's something interesting we can do as an experiment. We can read and write to a portion of RAM directly.

Using ramfs or tmpfs you can allocate part of the physical memory to be used as a partition. You can mount this 
partition and start writing and reading files like a hard disk partition. Since youâ€™ll be reading and writing 
to the RAM, it will be faster.

When a vital process becomes drastically slow because of disk writes, you can choose either ramfs or tmpfs file 
systems for writing files to the RAM.

    1. How to mount Tmpfs
This is done like a normal partition. That is, create a folder, then mount.
    -   mkdir -p /mnt/tmp
    -   mount -t tmpfs -o size=20m tmpfs /mnt/tm        # t limits the type of file system. -o is for options.
