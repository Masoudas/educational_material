The simplest way to list usb devices is to use the lsusb command

Note: a simple trick to see to which usb port a device is connected is to just disconnect, list usbs, and 
then reconnect the usb port.

$ lsusb
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:565a Realtek Semiconductor Corp. Integrated_Webcam_HD
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 046d:c52f Logitech, Inc. Unifying Receiver
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 8087:0026 Intel Corp. 
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub

The Bus ID, Device ID, USB ID, and a title is displayed in the output of lsusb command.
As we can see, several devices are attached to bus 1, including the integrated webcam on this device, as well
as other things.
