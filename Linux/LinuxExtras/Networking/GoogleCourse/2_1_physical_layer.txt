This is my domain of expertise, using coding etc. It moves around bits. They form packets or data frames.
They contain the physical devices like cards as well as information theory, modulation, etc.

Duplex communication means transmission of data in both directions. Simples means in one direction, like a
baby monitor. Full duplex means communication at the exact same time on the two sides of a network. Half
duplex means one device can communicate at the time, but communication is possible from both ends.

RJ45 or Registered Jack 45 is the most common type of cable. It's the one we use that contains two LEDs, one
for indicating a connection has been made (yellow light) and one for showing actuall transmission of data
(green light.) Green light shows blinks with each transmission. Yellow is linked light, green is activity light.
