ARP or address resolution protocol, is the protocol used to discover the ip address of a node with a certain ip address. 

ARP table connects the two in the server.

It may happen that there's no entry for this field. In this case, a broadcast message with the ip address is transmitted (broadcast ARP message.) The node with this ip on the network sends back and ARP response showing 
its mac address.  The transmitting machine then puts it in the ethernet frame and sends it.

ARP tables expire, and are updated.
