The process of breaking a large network and breaking it into many smaller ones. 

Gateway routers are entries to a particular part of the network (like the ones for class A 9.x.x.x ip addresses.)
Core routers on the other hand only speak to other core routers. 

So note that a class A has 16 million addresses. To many for a single server to handle. Subnetting then is used break down
ips into smaller ones, having their own gateways for them.
