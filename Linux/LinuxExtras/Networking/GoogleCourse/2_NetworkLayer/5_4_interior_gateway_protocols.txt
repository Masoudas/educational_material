Routing tables should be updated all the time. Routing protocls are used to share information among routers all throughout the world.

    -   Interior gateway protocols: Used to share info in a single autonomous system (i.e, a collection of networks that all fall under 
        the control of a single network operator. Like a company.)
        -   Link state routing protocols: Info i shared among all routers on the system. Algorithms are used to determine the shortest path 
            on each router by the router itself.
        -   Distance-vector protocols: Older standard. Just takes its table, and sends it to every router connected to it. As such, each router 
            would not know that much about the entire state of the system.
    -   Exterior gateway protocols: For exchange of info between independent networks
