They can be divided into two sections:
    -   Network id
    -   Host id

9.100.100.100 shows an IBM ip address (9,) and the next three octets indicate a host.

Address class system indicates how an ip address is constituted:
    -   Class A: First octet is used for network id. The last three for host.
        - Range of networks is 0-127. Range of hosts is ~16
    -   Class B: First two octet ..
        - Range of networks is 128-191. Range of hosts is 64000.
    -   Class C: First three octet ..
        - Range of networks is 192-224. Range of hosts is 254.

If the first bit is zero, it's class A. If first bits are 10, then its class B. 110 first bits means class C.
Hence, Class A has 0-127 as first octent. Class B has 128-191 as first, and class C 192-224 as first.

Class D starts with 1110, from 224-239, used for multi-casting. There's class E as well, but these two are not important.
