Hub: A physical layer device, which is the simplest of them all. IT doesn't do anything and has no protocols.
Propagates data to all connected devices, and they have to determine if the data was meant for them or not!
It causes a collision domain. A collision domain is a situation where a single device can talk over the net.
Because of collision domain, there are many quiet domains. Hubs are depracated.

Network switch: Came in place of hubs. It has data processing for sending data to particular clients. Switch
is a layer 2 device. The size of collision reduces with this device. A LAN (or local area network) is a
combination of switches and computers.

Routers: Routers connect independent networks. Therefore, routers work on layer 3, allowing connection of 
various IP addresses. They do this by storing internal tables for routing data. We have small network or office
routers as well of course. ISPs (Internet Service Providers) have very sophisticated routers. Border Gateway
Protocol is the protocol used for sharing data among large routers. It lets them know about the most optimal
path to tranport data.

Patch pannel: Contains many ports, but does no other work. We usually see these on the wall, and they connect
to switches and routers.
