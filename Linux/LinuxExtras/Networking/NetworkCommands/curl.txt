The curl command (let's say) reads a webpage from the Internet on the command line. As such, the page is read
from whatever format it's in (could be a raw html, or CSS, or whatever.) 

For example:
$ curl https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html > release.html

Reads the html page into our command line, and then we write into an html file, which we can read.

The following command reads the finger banner of the site, and thus prints the latest versions of the kernel
for us, where L stands for location, meaning if address is changed, it will follow it:

$ curl -L https://www.kernel.org/finger_banner
The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is:             5.12
The latest mainline version of the Linux kernel is:           5.12
