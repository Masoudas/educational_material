Each particular protocol (such as Http or ftp, etc,) uses a particular port number to:
	-	Ensure that the sender does not have to request the port every time
	-	The traffic is not shared on a particular port.


The ports from 0-1023 are allocated to particular protocls w(22 to ssh, 443 to https, 80 to http, etc.)
Ports between 1024 to 49151 to registered port numbers. Then, ports from 49152 to 65535 are dynamically allocated.

Note that (from my estimation) ports 0-1234 are listenning ports. When a browser for example sends an https 
request, it does not use port 443. Rather, it creates a dynamic port number. Port 443 is only a listenning
port. The protocol, however, is https on this randomly assigned port.
