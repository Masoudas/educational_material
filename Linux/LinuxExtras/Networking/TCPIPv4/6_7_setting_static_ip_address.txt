Just so that we stress the definition of static ip and what we mean by it:
"A static IP address is simply an address that doesn't change. Once your device is assigned a static IP address, 
that number typically stays the same until the device is decommissioned or your network architecture changes. 
Static IP addresses generally are used by servers or other important equipment."

"Static IP addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Your ISP may or may not allocate you a 
static IP address depending on the nature of your service agreement. We describe your options a little later, but 
for now assume that a static IP address adds to the cost of your ISP contract."

Now, question is, how can we set a static ip address? Well, we can go through each individual step using the ip
command, by setting ip, setting DNS server, setting default gateway (not the DHCP, because that would imply that
the network is dynamic.) The netplan folder in etc contains a file(s) "01-network-manager-all.yaml in my case", in 
which we can write the information for each individual internet module.

A sample of this file would contain something like this:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
network
    ethernets:
        enp0s3:
            dhcp4: yes
    version: 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

So we see that this particular example uses dhcp4 for module 'enp0s3' to dynamically (not statically) allocate ip.
If we wanted to make ip allocation static, we'd do as follows. Note that as always in the linux world, once we 
change a config file, we have to execute it, which is done below. Note that if we had any errors or typos, it will
appear once we apply the netplan.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
network
    ethernets:
        enp0s3:
            dhcp4: no
            addresses [192.168.1.1/24]
            gateway4: 192.255.1.0
            nameservers:
                addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1] 
    version: 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Then execute:
$ sudo netplan apply
