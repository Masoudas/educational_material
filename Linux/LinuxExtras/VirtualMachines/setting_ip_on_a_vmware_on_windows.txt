A problem that I always encounter is, how do I define an ip address for a vmware virtual machine installed on
Windows?

The answer is that by creating a virtual network, we can indeed use the ip address of Windows (or I think an ip
address allocated to a vmware machine.) The point is that once I've installed the Linux machine on it, I must
then edit my netplan file to create an ip address for the Linux machine, whose value is equivalent to that of the
Windows machine. As such, I can for example access this virtual machine remotely.

I had this problem with the server of the distribution system of Mashhad, where they had installed a vmware on a
Windows machine. They gave me an ip address, a NAT server, and a gateway ip, which made me wonder why that was the
case. But then I saw that the vmware machine had a virtual network, and as soon as I defined the ip address, things
were fine, and I could remote to the virtual machine.
