We should never forget that the public key is the key that we put in the authorized_key file of the server we
want to connect to. 

The private key always remains in our own remote machine. It shall never be divulged to anyone. We add the
private key which is generated in a particular to our keys using the ssh-add command.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/private_key

Note that in the remote machine, we don't have authorized keys, because it doesn't make sense.

An key is added to the authorized_keys on the server (the machine we want to connect to.) Yet, we add the private
key to the keys the remote machine checks (the machine that wants the connection) using ssh-add.

As reminder, note that for example if we're using a remote server, and we add a new user (other than root
let's say) then we need to make a new key for that particular user. Authentication is per user, not per 
machine. So if I want to connect to other_user@ip_address and I've created a key for root, I need to create
another key for other_user.
