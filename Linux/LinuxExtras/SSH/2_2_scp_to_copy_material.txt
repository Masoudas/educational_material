NOTE: Don't use secure copy to copy ssh-keys. For that, use the ssh-copy-id command

To copy a file from the remote machine to the server machine, we can use the scp command:

$ scp path_to_file username@ip_addr:path_in_dest

So, don't forget the colon after the username and ip address of the service to define the path.
