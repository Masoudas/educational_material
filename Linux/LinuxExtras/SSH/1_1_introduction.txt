SSH or Secure SHell, is a way of accessing the Linux machine remotely. 

To have ssh available on the Linux system, one needs only to install openssh-server. Once this package is
installed, ssh is provided as a service, and it can be checked via the systemctl command:

$ systemctl status ssh

After this step, all it remains is to connect to the machine which has ssh on it. To that end, first we need
to figure out the ipaddress of the hosting machine, which is done using the ip command:

$ ip -4 addr

Once the ip address of the linux is found, we can simply connect to a user with the ssh command:

$ ssh username@ip_address       # Same as user@hostname

Once this is run, the ssh keys are generated, and then we can connect by prompting the password.
