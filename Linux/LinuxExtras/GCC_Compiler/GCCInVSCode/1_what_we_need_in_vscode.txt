Essentially, VS code provides an editor which then uses GCC to compile C++ codes. Interestingly enough, what VS Code
uses is not gcc, but rather g++. If g++ is installed in the proper /usr/bin, then it will be easily detected by VS
and we can build or debug with it.

Aside from that however, there are several questions we need to ask ourselves:
    - How does VS find std?
    - Where does it build the object files or the final binary? And how can we change the path? (Unlike Windows VS,
      not everything is cut and dry, and we need to define paths explicitly.) 
    - How can we change the include and linker paths, to find possible additional C++ libraries?
    - How can we debug, as oppose to build?
    - How can we change the standard version and compilation flags?

Once again, we stress that g++ is what is must be used to compile c++ programs, and not gcc. Experimentally, I found
out with gcc, the std library can't be found for example.
