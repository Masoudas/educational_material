There are three build files associated with a project that essentiall determine what's going to happen:

    -   c_cpp_properties.json
        This file holds the fundamental settings of the C++ compiler. We can generate this file by finding in VS 
        commands menu (Shift+Ctrl+p) then C/C++ configuration edit. Simply put, this file contains compiler path 
        and IntelliSense settings.

    -   tasks.json
        This file defines a basic task for VS Code. In other words, it says for example "start debugging from this
        particular file's main function, the put the generated binary in that folder, etc. We can also see the field
        args, which contain the arguments passed to g++. In essence, compiler build settings information is there.

    -   launch.json
        This is file is generated for every project in any language I've seen so far. It contains the debug 
        information. Mostly, we don't need to touch this one.
