Installing a 64-bit Linux guest requires that CPU virtualization extension support (Intel VT-x or AMD-SV) be 
turned on within the host system's basic input/output system (BIOS) settings.

Thus, the flag we're looking for in Intel CPUs is vmx, and svm is the flag we look for in AMD CPUs.

We can check this flag in two ways. Note that we're writing one expression to look for both flags, but in
reality, we must check vms only for Intel and svm only for AMD:

1-  Through lshw -class cpu:
$ sudo lshw -class cpu | egrep --color "vmx|svm"

2-  Through checking the /proc/cpuinfo file
$ egrep --color "vmx|svm" /proc/cpuinfo

Note that these flags indicate that this property is available. Thus, we can actually enable it in the bios
setting. I also wonder if we can enable it from the "efibootmgr" or something similar.
