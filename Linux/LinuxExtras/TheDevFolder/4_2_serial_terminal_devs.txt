ttyS are serial terminal lines.

Terminal emulators go by many names, and, due to the varied use of the word terminal, there can often be 
some confusion about what someone means when they say terminal.

Terminal in old computers was the interface. Today, terminal programs are "emulating" the experience that 
was working on one of these terminals. They are known as emulators, applications, programs, terms, TTYs, and 
so on.

When working on a modern operating system, the word terminal window will often be used to describe working
within one of these applications.

COM Port (Serial Port) - Each device you connect to your computer will be assigned a specific port number. 
This helps to identify each device connected. Once a device has a port assigned to it, that port will be 
used every time that device is plugged into the computer.

Your device will show up on your computer as either COM# (if you’re on a Windows machine) or 
/dev/tty.usbserial-######## (if you’re on a Mac/Linux computer), where the #’s are unique numbers or 
alphabetic characters.

TTY - TTY stands for teletypewriter or teletype. Much like terminal is synonymous with the terminals of old, 
so too is teletype. These were the electromechanical typewriters used to enter information to the terminal and, 
thus, to the mainframe. When working with terminals on Mac and Linux, you will often see tty used to 
represent a communication port rather than 'COM port'.

Serial Port Profile (SPP) - The Serial Port Profile is a Bluetooth profile that allows for serial communication 
between a Bluetooth device and a host/slave device. With this profile enabled, you can connect to a Bluetooth 
module through a serial terminal. This can be used for configuration purposes or for communication purposes. 
While not exactly pertinent to this tutorial, it's still good to know about this profile if you want to use 
Bluetooth in a project.
