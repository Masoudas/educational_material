We can access memory devices throught the /dev/mem folder

$ ls -l /dev/dem
crw-r----- 1 root kmem 1, 1 avril 23 08:31 /dev/mem

Note that we are able to mount memory and actually read files from it and write to it, as discussed in
"StoragePartitionFormatMount" folder.

Note that not all the devices have dev file, one of which for example is the moniter, and that's because
it deals with the graphics card, and not with the OS. The video however is associated with the fb0 file,
which we know because it's group is video! then there's also the media files which is video, but is 
associated with CD-ROMs, etc.

crw-rw----  1 root     video    29,     0 avril 23 08:31 fb0
crw-rw----  1 root     video   237,     0 avril 23 08:31 media0 # CD-ROM devices.
