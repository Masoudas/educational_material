When installing linux, we want to ensure that boot occurs via UEFI, and not our legacy boot systems. For this,
we just need to ensure the firmware manager has figured out the UEFI on INSTALLATION. For that, when we're 
installing linux, we can check in the shell (before starting actuall installation):

$ ls /sys/firmware/efi

If this folder is not empty, then we're fine.
