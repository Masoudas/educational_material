On most computers, as of 2015, there's a bios setup in which we can navigate with mouse, and it has a very good
graphics. This is the UEFI bios menu. If we have to run with keyboard and we have a dos like menu, then it's 
legacy bios menu.

Essentially, we want to always disable legacy boots, particularly when installing new OS, especially with Linux,
because Windows just automatically does it for us. Exceptionally, I checked and my current machine does not
support legacy boot (the Vostro machine, AKA Gholam.)
