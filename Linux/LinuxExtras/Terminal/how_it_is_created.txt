A problem that I faced one time in Ubuntu was that the shortcut alt+ctrl+T did not create a terminal.

As such I checked, and because Ubuntu uses gnome-terminal, I actually discovered a python script in /usr/bin
called gnome-terminal, which was responsible for creating the terminal using the shortcut! Odd that a python
script is responsible.

The first line inside it is

#!/bin/python3

which indicates that it uses python3 to create terminals! I discovered later that the symbolic link to python3
was missing.
