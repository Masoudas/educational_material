Everything separated by TWO new lines is considered a paragraph. The { goes back one paragraph (the empty line 
on top of the paragraph), and the } goes to the beginning of the next one (the empty line at the end of the 
paragraph, or the last word of the text if there are no further ones.)

As always, we can combine these with numbers, and say for example go down two paragraphs.
