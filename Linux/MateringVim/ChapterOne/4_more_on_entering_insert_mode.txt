Often times you will want to change some piece of text for another one, and there's a command just for that c. 
The change command allows you to remove a portion of text and immediately enter an insert mode. Change is a 
compound command, meaning that it needs to be followed by a command which tells Vim what needs to be changed. 
Note also that the removed content goes into the clipboard.

Note that as an odd exception, cw acts like ce! Hence, it does not cut the space after the word.

Sometimes we just want to cut things, without putting anything instead, and d does just that. It stands for 
delete. It behaves similarly to c, except that the behavior of w and e is more standard. One again, the deleted
content will go into the clipboard.

There are also two more nifty shortcuts which allow you to change or delete a whole line:
    cc 	Clears the whole line and enters insert mode. Preserves current indentation level, which is useful when 
        coding.
    dd 	Deletes an entire line.
