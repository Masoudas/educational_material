Well, to build for RaberryPi, we need to actually a proper kernel version for the product from the appropriate source, which is 
https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/. 

Me: Why a particular kernel? I think because the mother of all kernels does not have a proper particular configuration for our 
RaberryPi board, and we don't know that much at this point to properly configure the kernel for it!

Note that in the particular

To copy the git source code, it's been suggested to use the following version of the command:
$ git clone --depth=1 --branch rpi-5.4.y https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git

Another reason that occurs to me why we need to download the specific kernel for RaberryPi is that we require additional headers
like openssl to build the kernel. Consequently, building directly from the kernel seems to present such issues, and which is why
it's best to use this ad-hoc version of the kernel.
