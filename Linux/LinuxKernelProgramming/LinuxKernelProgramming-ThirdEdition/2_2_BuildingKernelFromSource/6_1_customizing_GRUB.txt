GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is essentially modified when we build our kernel and install it, and we normally don't require 
any further steps. However, we shall demonstrate how to further customize the GRUB.

The grub settings are in the /etc/default folder.
$ cat /etc/default/grub

Remember to always keep a backup copy before tinkering with the file:
$ cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.orig

For example, to ensure that the GRUB boot menu always appears upon boot, we can setup the following option:
## GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false
Note: On some Linux distros, you might instead have the GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden directive; simply change it to 
GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=menu to achieve the same effect.

By setting the time out, we can set how long it takes to default boot the default OS. Note that 0 means boot right away, and -1 
means wait indifintely.
## GRUB_TIMEOUT=3   # Takes 3 seconds

After having tinkered with grub, always update it as follows:
$ sudo update-grub
The preceding command will typically cause the initramfs image to be refreshed (regenerated). Once done, you're ready to reboot the 
system.

The most important parameter here however is the GRUB_DEFAULT, which determines which kernel is going to be used by default. If 
this is set to 0, the first kernel (i.e, the most recently added one) will be used to boot the system with. However, we can 
change it as follows to be more specific about the kernel version:

GRUB_DEFAULT="Advanced options for Ubuntu>Ubuntu, with Linux 5.0.0-36-generic"  # Adds our kernel to Advanced options for Ubuntu
                                                                                # menu

Again, don't forget to run:
$ sudo grub-update

Change the background image using the following item:
## BACKGROUND_IMAGE="<img_file>"
