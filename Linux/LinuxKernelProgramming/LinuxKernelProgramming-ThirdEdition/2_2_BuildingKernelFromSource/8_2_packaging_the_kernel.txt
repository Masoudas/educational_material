Essentially, if we build the kernel for a particular target platform, we want to package it in a certain easy way, so that the 
customers of the built kernel can easily install it without any fuss. To that end, if we type "make help", we find the following 
approaches:

$ make help
Kernel packaging:
  rpm-pkg             - Build both source and binary RPM kernel packages
  binrpm-pkg          - Build only the binary kernel RPM package
  deb-pkg             - Build both source and binary deb kernel packages
  bindeb-pkg          - Build only the binary kernel deb package
  [...]
  targz-pkg           - Build the kernel as a gzip compressed tarball
  tarbz2-pkg          - Build the kernel as a bzip2 compressed tarball
  tarxz-pkg           - Build the kernel as a xz compressed tarball
  [...]

Hence, for example typing the following command helps:
$ sudo make bindeb-pkg     # Create a debian package!!!

And as we know, we can now install the package on any other machine that's compatible as follows:
$ dpkg -i <package-name>
