One of the OMG things about the GRUB menu is that it allows us to access the kernel without having to use a password. To that end,
once we access the boot menu, in front of the linux command, we add the single option:

$       linux /boot/vmlinuz-5.0.0-36-generic \ root=UUID=<...> ro quiet splash single

We're talking about the single at the end of the command. Once this is done, a reboot will give us access to an instance of the 
kernel without password. As such, we can simply use the passwrd command to replace the password!

Notice the vulnerability of the kernel as such! Therefore, we should not simply allow the GRUB boot menu to appear on system 
restart.
