The location of the kernel modules is in the famous /usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r).

To actually install them in this path, one needs to, well, run the specific install command of make for modules, which in this case 
is make modules_install.

$ sudo make modules_install

As soon as we do so, we'll see a new folder has been built with our modules inside of it. Incidentally, the 
/lib/modules/<kernel-ver>/modules.builtin file has the list of all installed kernel modules 
(under /lib/modules/<kernel-ver>/kernel/).

If we wanted to install modules in another location, we need to pass the INSTALL_MOD_PATH to the make command with the corresponding 
desired path. Why would we want this? In the case of cross compilation for example, we want to explicitly specify the path:
$ make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/ modules_install
