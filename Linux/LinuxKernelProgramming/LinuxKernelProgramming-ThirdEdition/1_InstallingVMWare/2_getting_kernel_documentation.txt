The community has developed and evolved the Linux kernel documentation into a good state over many years of effort. The latest 
version of the kernel documentation, presented in a nice and modern "web" style, can always be accessed online here: 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/.

We can also make the kernel documentation from source using the make command on the root folder:
$ make help   # shows the documentation version available
$ make pdfdocs
