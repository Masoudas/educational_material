SEALS or Simple Embedded ARM Linux System is a very simple "skeleton" Linux base system running on an emulated ARM machine. It 
provides a primary Bash script that asks the end user what functionality they want via a menu, then accordingly proceeds to 
cross-compile a Linux kernel for ARM, then creates and initializes a simple root filesystem. It can then call upon QEMU 
(qemu-system-arm) to emulate and run an ARM platform (the Versatile Express CA-9 is the default board emulated). The useful thing 
is, the script builds the target kernel, the root filesystem, and the root filesystem image file, and sets things up for boot. It 
even has a simple GUI (or console) frontend, to make usage a bit simpler for the end user.
