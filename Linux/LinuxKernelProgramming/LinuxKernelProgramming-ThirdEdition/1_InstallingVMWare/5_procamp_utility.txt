Visualizing the complete memory map of the kernel Virtual Address Space (VAS) as well as any given process's user VAS is what the 
procmap utility is designed to do.

The description on its GitHub page sums it up:
"It outputs a simple visualization of the complete memory map of a given process in a vertically-tiled format ordered by descending 
virtual address. The script has the intelligence to show kernel and userspace mappings as well as calculate and show the sparse 
memory regions that will be present. Also, each segment or mapping is scaled by relative size (and color-coded for readability). On 
64-bit systems, it also shows the so-called non-canonical sparse region or 'hole' (typically close to 16,384 PB on the x86_64)."
