Only points to recall is that we can mount the disk drive using the media option, which we use to install Ubuntu from an iso file.

Morever, in the Settings/General/Advanced, you want to have bi-directional clipboard and Drag'n drop, to be able to communicate
with the host machine. This may not work properly, and we need to install additional packages, discussed over the internet.
We might want to install additional features, which is in the download page as well. Once it's installed, we need to run the
"Insert Guest Additional CD Images" from the devices menu. Specifically, download VirtualBox Guest Additions. Then mount this 
drive inside the intalled ubuntu, and execute it as follows:
$ sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt 
$ sudo /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run 
$ systemctl reboot

Once the virtual Ubuntu is installed, we need to have the following additional packages:

sudo apt install git fakeroot build-essential tar ncurses-dev tar xz-utils libssl-dev bc stress python3-distutils libelf-dev 
linux-headers-$(uname -r) bison flex libncurses5-dev util-linux net-tools linux-tools-$(uname -r) exuberant-ctags cscope 
sysfsutils gnome-system-monitor curl perf-tools-unstable gnuplot rt-tests indent tree pstree smem libnuma-dev numactl hwloc 
bpfcc-tools sparse flawfinder cppcheck tuna hexdump openjdk-14-jre trace-cmd virt-what


In particular, pay attention to how the linux-headers are installed, as linux-headers-$(uname -r).
