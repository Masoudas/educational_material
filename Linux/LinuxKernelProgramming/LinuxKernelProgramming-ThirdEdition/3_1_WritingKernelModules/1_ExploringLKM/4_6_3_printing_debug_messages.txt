To enable the printing of the debug messages, we need to pass the DEBUG flag when compiling our codes. We can
do it in two ways (three ways):

	1-	Add the following line to the make file:
		CFLAGS_<filename>.o  :=  -DDEBUG
	2-	Insert the following line:
		EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DDEBUG

Essentially, don't use pr_debug for printing debug messages. Instead, it's recommended to use dev_dbg() macro.
