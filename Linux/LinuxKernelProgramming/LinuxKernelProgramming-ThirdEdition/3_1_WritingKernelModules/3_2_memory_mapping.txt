It is a well-known fact that the Linux kernel follows the monolithic kernel architecture. Essentially, a monolithic design 
is one in which all kernel components (that we mentioned in this section) live in and share the kernel address space (or 
kernel segment). This can be clearly seen in Fig 2.

Another fact you should be aware of is that these address spaces (for subsystems) are of course virtual address spaces and 
not physical. The kernel will (leveraging hardware such as the MMU/TLB/caches) map, at the page granularity level, virtual 
pages to physical page frames. It does this by using a master kernel paging table to map kernel virtual pages to physical 
frames, and, for every single process that is alive, it maps the process's virtual pages to physical page frames via individual 
paging tables for each process.
