To locate a file in the linux file system, we need only to use the locate command. But before we do that, we need
to update the file database, which we discuss next as follows:

$ updatedb  # update the file database
$ locate -w expression   # Finds any file that partially contains the expression. The -w does not seem to help!

For example, the following two expressions returned the same number of lines:
$ locate -w AAA | wc -l
$ locate -b AAA | wc -l

Hence, the only way I say how to search for a particular file was with a regular expression that had word 
boundary in it!!

$ locate -regex '\bexpression\b'

The manpage of updatedb states that "updatedb creates or updates a database used by locate(1). If the database 
already exists, its data is reused to avoid rereading directories that have not changed." Hence, this database
is part of the locate command, and not part of the linux shell.

Note that when we create a file in an open shell, the instance of db that's already loaded inside this shell
does not contain this file. Hence, we need to run the 'updatedb' command to ensure that it's updated.
