Recall that the operator # (or ## for greedy detection) is used for determining the extension of a file.
Also recall that %(or %% for greedy detection) is used for determining the basename of a file. Recall that these
two have to combined with either .* and *. to remover everything after, or everything before, respectively.

$ filename=file.txt
$ extension=${filename##*.}
$ basename=${filename%%.*}
