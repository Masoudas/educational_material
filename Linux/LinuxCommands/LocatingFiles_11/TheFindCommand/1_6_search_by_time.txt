The two options -mtime, -atime and -ctime search for files based on their modification, access or change times.
The number may be prefixed with - or + signs. The - sign implies less than, whereas the + sign implies greater than.
Times are in day unit.

$ find $HOME -mtime 1
Finds all files on the home folder that have been modified over the past 24 hours and before it.

$ find $HOME +atime 7
Find those that have been accessed over seven days till now.

There's also another version that gets time based on minute, with -amin, -cmin and -mmin are minute based options 
however. For these, we need to pass the minutes with another dash:
$ find / -mmin -60	# Access
$ find / -amin -60	# Modification
$ find / -cmin -60  # Change

This one is more interesting. It searches for a version that's modified after the given 'reference.txt' file. Meaning, if
there's a version of it that has a more recent modification time, that one is returned, otherwise nothing is returned. It's
particularly useful for writing backup scripts.

$ find . -newer reference.txt
