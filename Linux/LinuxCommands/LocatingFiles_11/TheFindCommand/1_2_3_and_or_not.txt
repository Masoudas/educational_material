find has the following operators listed in order of precedence (highest -> lowest)

	-	()
	-	!|-not
	-	-a|-and
	-	-o|-or

Note that () has higher precedence than !, and not higher than and, and and higher than or. We're allowed to use 
paranthesis to mess with the precedence of operators:

$ find . \( -name '*.txt' -o -name '*.pdf' \) -print
$ find . \( -name '*e*' -and -name 's*' \) 
$ find . ! -name "*.txt" -print		# Not ending in txt"
