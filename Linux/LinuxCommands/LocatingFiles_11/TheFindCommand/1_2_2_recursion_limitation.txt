To find a particular name, we use the following command:

$ find . [-name|iname] name [-print]

Note that this command now finds anything that matches this name in this folder and its children. Hence, for 
example if name=file_name and there's a folder and a file named file_name, both of them will be found, which 
is good, because we want to find everything. use full paths to avoid this,

Note that the file or folder name HAS to contain the name. Hence, for example if I have subfolder named 'f' and I
search for '*f*', not every file such as f/s.txt is returned (because they pass through the f folder.) Find is not a 
simple regex search on paths (Thankfully :D)

To set the depth of search, use the -maxdepth option, where 1 means only the current folder.

$ find . -maxdepth 1 -name expression     # Search only in the current folder.

Note: The -maxdepth and -mindepth option should be early in the find command. If they are specified as later arguments, it 
may affect the efficiency of find as it has to do unnecessary checks. For example, if -maxdepth is specified after a -type 
argument, the find command will first find the files having the specified -type and then filter out the files that don't 
match the proper depth. However, if the depth was specified before the -type, find will collect the files having the 
specified depth and then check for the file type, which is the most efficient way to search.

To search for files or folders, use the -type option together with f or d
$ find . -type f -maxdepth 1 -name expression

Note that when passing wild-cards for names, we want to put it inside a single quote. If there's no quote or a 
double quote, the shell expands the wild-card. The single quotes prevent the shell from expanding the *.txt and 
passes that string to the find command. Now, what does this mean? 

$ find . -name '*.txt'
$ find . -name *.txt

When we say *.txt, what the shell does is that it resolves the glob * IN THE CURRENT FOLDER. This implies that it
searches for all files and folders in the current path that satisfy the *.txt, and it puts them as argument to
the find command (relative path to them of course). Hence, find will just return those paths, because there's 
only one corresponding match for them. On the other hand, if we pass '*.txt' to shell, this string is passed to
the command, and it's expanded in the file, and it implies every file that ends with text. Consider this:
(Note: It's been said that quotes both single and double supress wildcard. So, there's a slight diff here.)

./
  f1.txt
  d1/
	f2.txt

$ find . -name *.txt | wc -l	# *.txt is expanded by shell to ./f1.txt, and this is passed to find. 1 is
								# returned.
$ find . -name '*.txt' | wc -l	# *.txt is passed to the find command. Result would be 2.

$ find . -name "*.txt" | wc -l	# Same as '' example.
