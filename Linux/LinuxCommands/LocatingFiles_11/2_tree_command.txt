Tree is a nice CLI tool for visualizing the folder structure of pass. It has to be installed however:

$ tree PATH

To display only files that match a pattern, use the -P option:
$ tree path -P PATTERN # Pattern should be wildcard in single quotes

To display only files that do not match a pattern, use the -I option.
$ tree path -I PATTERN

To print the size of the files, use the -h option:
$ tree -h

Use the -H command to generate the output in HTML!
$ tree PATH -H http://localhost -o out.html	# the local host means the root directory. Nothing serious!
