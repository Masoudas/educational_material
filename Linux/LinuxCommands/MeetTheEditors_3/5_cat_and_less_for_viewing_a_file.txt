cat stands for concatenate, and can be used to view a single file. If we chain the name of a couple of files together, cat will
concatenate them together (only for view)

The 'tac' command is the reverse of cat, and shows the file in reverse (funny).

The command 'more' displays the content of a file in a page by page manner. To go to next line, press enter. To go to next page,
press space. To go back a page, press b.

'less' is an improvement over more. with less, we can go up and down a file with the arrow keys, and page up and down.

Also the commands head or tail show a certain number of lines from the beginning or end of the file.
