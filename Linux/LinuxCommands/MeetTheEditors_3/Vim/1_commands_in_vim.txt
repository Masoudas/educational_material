    -   Commands in Vim are combinations of verb + noun
    -   Commands are repeatable and undoable in the command mode:
        -   Use dot to repeat a command
        -   Use u to undo change. A combination 4u undoes the last four operations.
        -   To redo changes, ctrl+R or a version with quantifiers (4ctrl+R) can be used.
