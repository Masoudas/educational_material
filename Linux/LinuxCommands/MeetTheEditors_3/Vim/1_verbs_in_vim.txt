-   Verbs
Verbs are the actions we take, and they can be performed on nouns. Here are some examples:

    -   d: delete
    -   c: change
    -   y: yank (copy)
    -   v: visually select (V for line vs. character)

-   Modifiers
Modifiers are used before nouns to describe the way in which you're going to do something. Some examples:

    -   i: inside
    -   a: around
    -   NUM: number (e.g.: 1, 2, 10)
    -   t: searches for something and stops before it
    -   f: searches for that thing and lands on it
    -   /: find a string (literal or regex)

-   Nouns

In English, nouns are objects you do something to. They are objects. With Vim it's the same. Here are some Vim 
nouns:

    -   w: word (or W for anything up to a blank space or end of line)
    -   s: sentence (or S for an entire line.)
    -   ): sentence (another way of doing it)
    -   p: paragraph
    -   }: paragraph (another way of doing it)
    -   t: tag (think HTML/XML)
    -   b: block (think programming)

You can also use nouns as motions, meaning you can move around your content using them as the size of your jump. 

Examples:
$ d2w     # Delete two words (from the position of curser. A space between words is not considered a word. However,
          # If I stand on a space, it's considered a word. A punctutation mark at the end is not a word.)
$ cis     # Delete the current, and enter insertion mode (c or change) inside sentence.  
$ ct<     # Change till bracket.
$ dt.     # Delete (cut) to dot
$ yt;     # Yank to semicolon.
