To delete the rest of:
    - sentence, type D.
    - paragraph, visually select to the end of paragraph with v} and x for delete.
    - document from where you're: We know that gg is the beginning of document, and G$ goes to the end of the
      document. We also need to visually select and delete. Hence, vG$x deletes from current position to the end of 
      the file.
    - To delete from the current line to the end, a simple dG suffices.
