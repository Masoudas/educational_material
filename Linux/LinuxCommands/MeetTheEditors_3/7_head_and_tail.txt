By now, we know most uses of head and tail:

$ seq 10 | head -n 4	# Comapre to echo {1..10} | tail -n 4, where we print all 10, because no new line is added
$ seq 10 | head -n -4	# This is negative 4, meaning don't print the LAST four lines.

$ seq 10 | tail -n 4	# Last four
$ seq 10 | tail -n -4	# Same as 4!
$ seq 10 | tail -n +4	# Now, skip the first four, but print the rest!

tail has an interesting property, allowing us to track changing files with the -f option. This is very good, when
for example we want to check changing log files:

$ tail -f /var/log/messages

Another interesting case is to tail -f something till the dying of a process. This can be done as follows:
$ PID=$(pidof FOO)	# Equivalent to pgrep
$ tail -f --pid $PID

So, this tail dies as soon as the attached process id dies.
