Every process in Linux is represented by a directory in /proc. The numbers correspond to the process ids.

Inside a process' directory, you can find a lot of valuable and insightful information about the process. For  
example, you will find a soft link named exe that points to the process' executable file.

You will also find the status file, which stores various pieces of information about a process; these include the 
process state, the PPID, the amount of memory used by the process, and so on:
root@ubuntu-linux:/proc/6849# head status 
Name: firefox
Umask: 0022
State: S (sleeping) Tgid: 6849
Ngid: 0
Pid: 6849
PPid: 1990
TracerPid: 0
Uid: 1000 1000 1000 1000
Gid: 1000 1000 1000 1000

The limits file displays the current limits set for the process:
Limit                  Soft Limit   Hard Limit   Units
Max cpu time           unlimited    unlimited    seconds
Max file size          unlimited    unlimited    bytes
Max data size          unlimited    unlimited    bytes
Max stack size         8388608      unlimited    bytes
Max core file size     0            unlimited    bytes
Max resident set       unlimited    unlimited    bytes
...

The fd directory will show you all the files that the process is currently using on your system

You can also use the lsof command to list all the files a process is using:
$ lsof -p PID_NUMBER | tail

Note: We may recall also that the list of environment variables passed to a process is in the env file, for which
we needed to use the tr command to print properly:
$ less env | tr '\0' '\n'
