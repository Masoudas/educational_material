The niceness scale of a process (ranging from -20 to 19) determines the priority of a process, with -20 being
the highest, and 19 being the lowest. 

In fact, in a linux system, priorities are 0 to 139 in which 0 to 99 for real-time and 100 to 139 for users. 
Consequently, a value of -20 indicates a lower value from 120, or higher priority.

To get the niceness of a process, we can do as follows:
$ ps -o nice -p PID_NUMBER
NI
0

We can also set the niceness of a process using the nice command:
$ nice -n -20 PROCESS_NAME    # Set it to -20. Note that this runs the command with the given priority.
                              # We can't reset the priority of current process with this commadn

$ sudo nice -n -20 apt-get upgrade
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To reset the niceness of a process, use the renice command.
renice -n 19 -p PID_NUMBER
