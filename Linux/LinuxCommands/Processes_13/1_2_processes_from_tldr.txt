Note that there's a difference between a and -a. We can not print processes associated with a terminal, or that are not
session leaders. With a, we nullify this option. -e printa all processes.

u with no dash stands for user oriented format (shows parent, CPU and memory usage. command, start time, etc.) With a 
dash, it implies a particular user name list. Another suggestion here would be to use f.

x lifts the BDS restriction that the process should be associated with a terminal.

The tldr (The Linux Documentation PRoject) command gives us the following useful options on this command:

    - List all running processes:
    ps aux

    - List all running processes including the full command string:
    ps auxww

    - Search for a process that matches a string:
    ps aux | grep {{string}}

    - List all processes of the current user in extra full format:
    ps --user $(id -u) -F

    - List all processes of the current user as a tree:
    ps --user $(id -u) f

    - Get the parent pid of a process:  # o means a user defined format, to which we pass ppid. Hence output is ppid.
    ps -o ppid= -p {{pid}}

    - Sort processes by memory consumption:
    ps --sort size
