Now that we understand how the process works, we may wonder how we can see the process tree? 

First, I recently encountered the command pstree:
$ pstree $USERNAME

prints the processes of a user.

The man pages of ps also shows that (by a /tree search inside the manpage) that:
%%%%%%%%
To print a process tree:
        $  ps -ejH
        $  ps axjf
%%%%%%%%

Checkout the options on pstree as well. For example:
$ pstree -h # Highlights parents of the current process
$
