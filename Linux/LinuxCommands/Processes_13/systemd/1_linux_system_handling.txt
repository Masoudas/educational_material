Historically, Linux has been managed with several smaller pieces. For example, init was the first process on the system, 
which started other processes and daemons to bring up the system. System daemons were handled by shell scripts, also 
called init scripts. Logging was done either by the daemon itself via files or syslog. Networking was also handled by 
multiple scripts (and still is in some Linux distributions).

Nowadays, though, the entire system is handled by systemd. For example, the first process on the system is now systemd 
(which we have seen in previous chapters). Daemons are handled by something called unit files, which create a unified 
way of controlling daemons on the system. Logging is handled by journald, systemd's logging daemon. But do note that 
syslog is still used by many daemons to do extra logging. 

Knowing how systemd works will enable you to use it properly when, for example, writing unit files for daemons. It will 
also help you to write daemons in the "new" way, to make use of systemd's logging features. You will become a better 
system administrator as well as a better Linux developer.
