Start by typing systemctl to see all active units on your machine right now. If you skim through the list, you'll notice 
that a unit can be just about anythingâ€”hard drives, sound cards, mounted network drives, miscellaneous services, timers, 
and so on.

The list of all units reside in /etc/systemd/system and /lib/systemd/systemd. The latter is package unit files, 
whereas the former is called local unit files. Local unit files mean unit files specific to this system, for example, 
modified by the administrator or manually added for some program.

Now, type journalctl to see the logging unit of systemctl.
$ journalctl	# Type G to go to the end, otherwise it shows a long time back!

Read the following man pages for more information:
$ man systemd
$ man systemctl
$ man journalctl
$ man systemd.unit
