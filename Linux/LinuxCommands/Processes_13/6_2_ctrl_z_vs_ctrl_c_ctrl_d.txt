While we're on the subject, note that when ctrl+C is pressed, a kill signal (i.e, a SIGINT) is sent to the
process. Ctrl+C also sends a kill signal to termina. Note, however, that pressing ctrl+Z sends a freeze signal to the 
process.

In 9_listing_background_jobs, we demonstrate a way to continue background processes that are frozen with 
another tool other than sending a continue signal.
