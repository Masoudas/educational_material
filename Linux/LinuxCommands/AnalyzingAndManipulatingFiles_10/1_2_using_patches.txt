The unified output of diff is called a patch file, and it can be used to make changes to either file of the diff
command to update them. The command used to that end is patch:

$ diff -u f1 f2 > patch
$ diff -p1 f1 < patch

We might as well revert the changes if not satisfied, by repeating the same command:
$ diff -p1 f1 < path
