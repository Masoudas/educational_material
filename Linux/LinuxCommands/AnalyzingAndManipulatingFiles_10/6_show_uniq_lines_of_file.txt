To show the unique lines of files, we can use the unique command. Note however that by unqiue here we mean adjacent
lines that are unique. If a file has repeated lines, we have to sort it first, then show the unique lines.

$ unique file

As such, it's common to use sort and uniq together:
$ sort file | unique

Notice that the -u does not show the duplicated lines at all

$ echo -e "1\n2\n2\n3" | unique -u	 # Shows no 2.
1 
3	

The -c option shows how many times a line has appeared:
$ echo -e "1\n2\n2\n3" | unique -c	 # Shows no 2.
1 1
2 2
1 3
