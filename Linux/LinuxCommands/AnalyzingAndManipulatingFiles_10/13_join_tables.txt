The join command is used for joining two files based on a common field (much like an SQL table.)

# Table 1
1	Iran
2	Uk
3	Germany

# Table 2
1	Tehran
2	London
3	Berlin

$ join table1 table2
1 Iran Tehran
2 Uk London
3 Germany Berlin

Of course, there are options and other things on how to join the two, but we shall skip them for now.
