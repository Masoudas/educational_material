The stream editor allows us to stream a file, and edit it at the same time. The command is sed (stream edittor.)
The commands are pretty much like vim, in that for example, to replace a word in a file, we need only to supply
the 's' tag (short for substitute) as follows:

$ sed -i 's/search_pattern/replace_word/' file   # -i is used to write the replaced pattern.

To make it as consistent with vim as possible, we can write:
$ sed -i '1,$ s/search_pattern_replace_word/g' file     # g stands for global

Note that:
    -   The search is case sensitive (as always)
    -   Note that d is used for deleting.
