Using sed, we can remove blank lines. Note that, however, this should not be done by substituting blank lines with
nothing, because nothing is interpreted as a blank line for some unGodly reason.

Instead, what we do is, we delete lines. Notice that we don't use s to start here:
$ echo -e "Mom,\n\nI'm in the bill" | sed  '/^$/d' file
or:
$ sed -i '/^$/d' file
