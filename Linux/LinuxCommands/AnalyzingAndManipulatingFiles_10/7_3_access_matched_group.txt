Note also that we can get the matched string with &:
$ echo this is an example | sed 's/\w\+/[&]/g'  # Put every matched word inside a bracket. Notice the use of \+
                                                # instead of \w+, because this would imply a normal string.
[this] [is] [an] [example]

To access a matched group, we use \ notation:

$ echo seven EIGHT | sed "s/\([a-z]\+\) \([A-Z]\+\)/\2 \1/'
