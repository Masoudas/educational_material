It's possible to cut the text inside the file to be viewed, allowing us to show certain parts of the file using
the 'cut' command. 

For example:

$ cut -d ' ' -f1 facts.txt 

In this example:
    -  'd' stands for delimeter
    -   f1 stands for the first instance.

$ ls -lha  | cut -d ' ' -f1     # Shows only the permission part of the directory.

The following version shows the first AND third word:

$ cut -d ' ' -f1,3 file.txt
