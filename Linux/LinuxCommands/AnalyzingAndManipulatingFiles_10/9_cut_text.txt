It's possible to cut the text inside the file to be viewed, allowing us to show certain parts of the file using
the 'cut' command. 

For example:

$ cut -d ' ' -f1 facts.txt 

In this example:
    -  'd' stands for delimeter
    -   f1 stands for the first instance.

$ ls -lha  | cut -d ' ' -f1     # Shows only the permission part of the directory.

The following version shows the first AND third word:

$ cut -d ' ' -f1,3 file.txt

Also note that the complement option --complement shows the complements of the fields:

$ cut -f3 --complement student_data.txt

Interestingly enough, we can define the output delimiter with cut:

$ cut -f1,3,5 my_file.txt --output-delimiter ";"

Also, don't forget that we can cut based on the number of chars, or bytes, etc, using -c, -b, etc.
