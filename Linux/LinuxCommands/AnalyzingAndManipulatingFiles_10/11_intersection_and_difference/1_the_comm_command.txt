The comm command is the go to command the union and intersection of two files.

Essentially as always, when it comes to doing such things, we know that the program is not going to compare every line
of one file to another. Therefore, what we need is to ensure the files are SORTED first.

A typical usage of the command comm involves the following example. Consider the file A.txt and B.txt
A.txt		B.txt
apple		apple
carrot		banana


$ comm A.txt -o A.txt; comm B.txt -o B.txt;
$ comm A.txt B.txt
                apple
        banana
carrot
        cookies

We see that the content are printed in three columns. If the line is found in both files (not necessarily on the same
line, but possibly in different lines,) then they're printed in column three. Otherwise, the next line in between the 
two files with lowest sort order is printed, and if it belongs to file 1, it will be printed in column 2, and otherwise
in column 2. Each of the columns are delimited using the tab (\t) character.
