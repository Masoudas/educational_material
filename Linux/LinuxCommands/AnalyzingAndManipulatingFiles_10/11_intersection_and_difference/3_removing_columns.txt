A question that may arise here is that can we move the \ts and make everything into one column? The answer is that yes 
we can, using a tool like sed or tr:

$ comm A.txt B.txt -1 -2 | tr '\t' '\0'	# Note that we replace with '\0' and not with '\n', because there's nothing after
										# after a '\t'. Otherwise, we would have used '\n'
$ comm A.txt B.txt | sed -s 's/\t//'
