Now, if we decided to see only one of the three columns, we can pass the -1, -2 or -3 columns, where passing each
of these implies that that column will not be printed:

$ comm A.txt B.txt -1 -2
apple

Now, here's what's interesting. If we type -1 -2, we imply the intersection of the two files. On the other hand, if 
we punch in -2 -3, we imply A-B, and with -1 -3 vice versa.

$ comm A.txt B.txt -2 -3
carrot
mellon

$ comm A.txt B.txt -1 -3
banana
cookies

Point here is that the blank lines would not be printed.
