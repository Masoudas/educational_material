So let's say we want to execute a shell command inside awk. The way to do it is to use double quotation around
the command. The point however is that we need to usually read the result of the command. awk provides a piping
fascility for us, allowing us to pipe the result. If we use get line in this fascility, it will read the first
line of the result. Then, we can use $n to read the nth column of the result. Moreover, further lines can be
read by using more getline commands.

To better use this piping fascility, we better close the command after. To that end, we better execute the 
command as shown below.

ls -lS --time-style=long-iso WorkingWithFiles_2 | awk ' BEGIN { 
		getline;	# Doing nothing with the first line. 
	} 
	{
		cmd = "cat " $8
		cmd | getline; c11=$1; getline; c22=$2;		# Read row one, column one and row two column two
		close(cmd)
		print c11 " " c22
	}
	'
