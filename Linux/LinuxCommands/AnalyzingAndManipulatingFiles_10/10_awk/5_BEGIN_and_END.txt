Note that whereas the method inside {} is executed for each individual line, and as such, we don't need to write
getline inside of it, BEGIN and END method methods are executed before processing individual lines with awk.
As such, we are allowed to do some preprocessing with BEGIN and END methods.

For example, consider ls -l. We see that the result is the following:
total 76
drwxrwxr-x 2 masoudas masoudas 4096 ao√ªt   7 13:35 10_awk
drwxrwxr-x 2 masoudas masoudas 4096 juil. 27 15:47 11_intersection_and_difference

Now, if we wanted to do some processing on the lines of ls, the problem remains that the line 'total 76' has no 
valuable information. We can get read of it by reading a single line in BEGIN, and then dropping it out:

$ ls -l | awk ' BEGIN { getline;	# Throw this line out! } { print $9 } '	# Prints file names
