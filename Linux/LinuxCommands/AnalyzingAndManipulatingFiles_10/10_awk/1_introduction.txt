awk is a very powerful tool that Seyed likes that we can use in Linux to analyze and process text. In fact, awk 
is actually a programming language. We will find books that are solely written to explain and discuss the use of 
awk.

To print the first word in each line of the text, we can use:
$ awk '{print $1}' file.txt     # Prints first word.

Note that we didn't specify the delimiter in this case, and in fact, it can be any form space (like tab for 
example.) This however, wasn't the case with the cut command.

$ ls lha | awk '{print $1, $2}'    # First and second words

There are a couple of fields that are important inside awk:
	-	NR: Current line number
	-	NF: Current field number
	-	$n:	nth field

For example:
$ awk 'NR < 5' # first four lines are processed only.
$ awk '!/linux/'
$ awk '/linux/'
