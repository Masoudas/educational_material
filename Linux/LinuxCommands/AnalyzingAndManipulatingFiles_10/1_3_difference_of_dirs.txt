Instead of using find and then comm to find the difference between two dir content, we can use diff. 

Using diff directly with two files, well, shows the difference in their content. Using it with two directories
on the other hand would show the difference in the content of the dirs:

$ diff dir1 dir2

The above would show the difference, and we can read it. However, we can create a unified output using the -u
option as well. Moreover, if we wanted to recursively go through the content, we can supply the -r option. Also,
by passing the a option, we can consider all files as text (is it necessary?).

It has been suggested to pass the -N option as well, which would treat absent files as empty. In my experience,
this option would ignore a file if it's empty:
$ diff -Naur folder1 folder2
