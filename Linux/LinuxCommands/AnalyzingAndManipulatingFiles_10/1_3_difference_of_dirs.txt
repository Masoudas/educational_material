Instead of using find and then comm to find the difference between two dir content, we can use diff. The options
are as follows:

$ diff -Naur folder1 folder2
where:
	-	N: Treat missing files as empty
	-	a: Consider all files as text file
	-	u: To generate the unified outpu
	-	r: To recursively go through files.
