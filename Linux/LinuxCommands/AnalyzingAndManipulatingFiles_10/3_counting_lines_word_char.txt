A useful command is wc, that does not stand for bathroom, but rather "Word Count". If used without options, it
would display a triple of number of lines, number of words and number of chars. We can however use the options
-l, -w, -c to display them individually.

$ wc file
$ wc -l file
$ wc -w file
$ wc -c file
