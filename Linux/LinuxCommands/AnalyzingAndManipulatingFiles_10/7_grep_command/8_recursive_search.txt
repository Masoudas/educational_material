Obviously, we can create the following command with a mixture of find and grep (and xargs). However, grep provides 
a way to recursively look for a pattern inside a file. That is, we can provide a pattern, a path, recursion flag 
and that's it. Note that -R is the same as -r:

$ grep "test_function()" . -R -n
./miscutils/test.c:16:test_function();

This is equivalent to:

$ find . -type f | xargs grep "test_function()"

We can include and exclude files as well, using --include and --exclude:
$ grep "main()" . -r  --include *.{c,cpp}
$ grep "main()" . -r --exclude "README"
$ grep main . -r -exclude-dir CVS
