If we want to show the lines for which no match exists, we use -v which stands for inverse. Moreover, -n shows
the line number of found matches.

$ grep -vn "the" BSD

Of course, -n by itself just gives the line numbers that contain the pattern:

$ grep -n "the" BSD

To count the number of LINES (not finds) found, we use the dash c option. We can of course, use wc with -c and
-l to do the same.

$ grep pattern file | wc -l
$ grep pattern file | wc -c

The -b option will print the offset of the line in which a match occurs. Adding the -o option will print the exact 
character or byte offset where the pattern matches (note that both are from the beginning of the line):

$ echo gnu is not unix | grep -b -o "not"
7:not
