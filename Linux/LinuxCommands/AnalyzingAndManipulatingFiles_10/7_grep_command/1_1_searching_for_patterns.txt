The famous grep command (get regular expression) is the go to command to search for a regular expression in any
context. We normally pipe it with the output of commands to search the std, or we can use it directly to search
for a pattern.

$ ls . | grep .txt  # look for txt files.
$ grep -i my_pattern file1 file2 file3   # Look for "my_pattern" in the txt file. -i stands for ignore case.

The -l option will print which files contain the pattern. It's interesting that L is the inverse of it. That is,
-L will show the files that don't contain the pattern:

$ grep -l pattern file1 file2 file3
$ grep -L pattern file1 file2 file3

We can use -Z with grep (which is usually the case) to replace spaces with \0, which is useful (just like in the
case of find:)

$ grep "test" file* -lZ | xargs -0 rm
