Imagine we want to remove a line from a file that has regex as an expression. How do we go about that?
Think before you read the answer!

Answer:
First, we search the grep, to ensure that there's only one instance of it:

$ grep regex file
# Only one instance exists

Now, getting the reverse of the expression gives us all the lines excluding that line:
$ grep -v regex file

Now, streaming this to the file saves the day. The problem is that we can't both open a file with grep and 
then write to it at the same time. Hence, we copy the result to a temp, and then mv that temp into the 
actual file!

$ grep -v regex file > temp | mv temp file  # Replacing | with && does not work!
