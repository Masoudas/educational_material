To use extended possiblity of grep, use -E. The following three expressions are equivalent:

$ grep "\(grouping\)" file.txt
$ grep -E "(grouping)" file.txt
$ egrep "(grouping)" file.txt

What's the difference between normal and extended regular expressions?
A regular expression is a search pattern that grep command matches in specified file or in provided text. In order 
to allow a user to express the regular expression in more customized way, grep assigns special meanings to few 
characters. These characters are known as Meta characters. Initially, grep assigned the characters ^ $ . [ ] and 
* as Meta characters. Later few more characters were added in this list. These were ( ) { } ? + and |.

Consequently, it always best to add the -E before the grep command.
