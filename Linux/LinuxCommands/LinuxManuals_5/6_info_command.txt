The GNU project launched the info pages as an alternative documentation to the man pages. The GNU project once claimed that man
pages are outdated and needed replacement and so they came up with the info pages.

The command 'info command' therefore gives documentation on the command. Sometimes these documentations are more complete than
man pages.
