The man command together with the name of the command shows the man pages for that command.

There's also a man page for man. In it, it has been stated that man pages are usually under a folder like usr/share.

Note shell bulletin commands don't have man pages. It also says in a documentation such as 'cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]' for the
cd command, the | means either one of the options. [] means any or all things inside are optional.
