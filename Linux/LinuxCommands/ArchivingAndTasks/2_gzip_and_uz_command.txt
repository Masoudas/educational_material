gzip and uz according to linux documentation are the same as 'tar -xzf file', and are provided in some linux distros. It's however interesting to me that some
packages that I've downloaded that (I think have) .2gz can't be extracted with the tar command.

gunzip  takes  a  list of files on its command line and replaces each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which begins with 
the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without the original extension.  gunzip also recognizes the special extensions .tgz and .taz as shorthands 
for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.  When compressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of truncating a file with a .tar extension.

Example usage are:
gzip -c file1  > foo.gz         # It appears we cannot add more than one file here!
gzip -c file2 >> foo.gz         # Double > means add to existing, otherwuse using only one > completely overrides the archive.

Then for unzip:
gunzip -c foo
