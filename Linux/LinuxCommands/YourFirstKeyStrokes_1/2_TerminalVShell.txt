WHAT IS A TERMINAL EMULATOR? HENCEFORTH REFERRED TO AS TERMINAL

A Terminal Emulator is a program that emulates (mimics) a physical Terminal (Console). The Terminal interacts with the Shell 
(the Command Line Interface).

WHAT IS A SHELL?

The Shell is a command-line interpreter, that is to say, it is a program that processes and executes commands.


So for example, the command 'date' prints the current date. This command is written in the terminal, and is interpreted by the
shell, for which the kernel fetches the current date. 'date > today.txt' puts the result of the command in a file named today.txt


You should also know that command options are either preceded by a single hyphen (-) or a double hyphen (--). You can use a single 
hyphen if you are using the abbreviated name of the command option. On the other hand, if you are using the full name of the 
command option, then you need to use a double hyphen.

The complete list of shells on the system can be found on /etc/shells, which is a file containing the name of all the shells on the linux distro.
