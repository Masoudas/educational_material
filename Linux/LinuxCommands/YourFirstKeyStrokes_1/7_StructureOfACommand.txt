Note that any command has the following structure:

name option arguments

We're aware of name and option. Arguments are name of files or other information that we may pass to the command. 
For example, in ls -la ~, ~ is the argument we pass.

Note that options can be passed separately, like 'ls -l -a ~'. In particular, with ls we can pass several arguments, like
ls -la ~ /
