Say we wanted to just list regular files, or folders. How do we go about that?

The answer relies on the fact that in long listing, the first letter indicates the type of the file. Hence,
we can use a egrep command to extract what we desire:

$ ls -l | egrep '^-'    # Regular files.
$ ls -l | egrep '^d'    # directories.
