Beside using the ip command, the folder that contains all the available network interface on the machine is
found at /sys/class/net:

$ ls /sys/class/net
lo  wlp0s20f3

This shows that I have a wifi and a loop on my machine at this point, and nothing else is available. Note
that is NOT the list of all available network devices, because right now on my machine, I have an ethernet
as well. That I can check with lshw.
