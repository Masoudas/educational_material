To enable or disable modules, we can use the nmcli toolset. We can indeed list our radio devices as such:

$ nmcli radio

Then for example to turn on/off the wifi module, we can write:

$ nmcli radio wifi on # Oder off

Another method is to turn down or up using the ip suite. But note that this does not shut down the device, but 
rather shuts down the particular interface of the device (found it using tldr by the way:)

$ ip link set DEVICE_NAME down	(For example eth, ...)

Now finally, the lowest level form of this is to manage devices with unmanaged-devices feature in 
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. There are manpages on these stuff if we search for NetworkManager.
