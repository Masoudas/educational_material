As we may recall, we can set the DNS server using the /etc/resolv.conf file.

We can get our gateway using the route suite of the ip address, which shows our route:
$ ip route

There's a command called nslookup that will give us the ip address of a particular name:

$ nslookup asroma27.com
Server:         127.0.0.53          # Address of the DNS server, and not the website in the resolv.conf file
Address:        127.0.0.53#53   

Non-authoritative answer:       # Ok, it says non-authoritative answer. This is because we connect to 
                                # Asroma27.com/v16 I guess
Name:   asroma27.com
Address: 74.208.236.115     # Website ip address.
Name:   asroma27.com
Address: 2607:f1c0:100f:f000::2b2

Note that if we messed with resolv.config, we get the following error:
root@ubuntu-linux:~# ping facebook.com
ping: facebook.com: Temporary failure in name resolution

We can also for example use the DNS server of google at 8.8.8.8. By doing so, for example the ip address of
a famous website like facebook changes. This is because facebook has different ips on various servers.
