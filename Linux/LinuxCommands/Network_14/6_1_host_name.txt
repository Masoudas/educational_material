There are several ways to get the host name of current machine:

$ hostname
$ echo $HOSTNAME
$ less /etc/hostname
$ hostnamectl   # Discussed next.

If several hosts are on the same network, we can ping them. For example, if another host name called RAT_BABY
is on this network, I can ping it as follows:

$ ping RAT_BABY

I can also ping myself in the following way, which uses the loopback:
$ ping $HOSTNAME
