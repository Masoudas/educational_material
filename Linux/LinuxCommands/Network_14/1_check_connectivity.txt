An easy way to check connectivity is to use the ping command with a particular website for example:

$ ping google.com

The ping command sends a packet (unit of data) called an ICMP echo request to the specified host and waits for 
the host to send back a packet called an ICMP echo reply to confirm that it did receive the initial packet. If 
the host replies as we see in our example, then it proves that we were able to reach the host. This is like 

Notice that without any options, the ping command keeps sending packets continuously, and it won't stop until 
you hit Ctrl + C. with the -c option, we can specify how many packets we want to send:
$ ping -c 3 google.com

If we're not connected to any network, we get
$ ping -c 3 google.com
ping: google.com: Name or service not known


The other way to check RX/TX is to use the ip -s addr
