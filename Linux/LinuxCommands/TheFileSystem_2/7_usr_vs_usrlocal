As we already mentioned, usr is normally where new software binary or libraries are installed. The opt folder is apparently rarely 
used these days for this purpose.

However, an important distinction should be made. Often, we install software using apt-get or such. However, sometimes, we compile
software from the source.

    - If software is installed from apt-get or such sources directly, it will go to the usr/bin or usr/lib folders.
    - On the other hand, software compiled from software is installed in usr/local/bin or usr/local/lib.

Note that the latter, is a normal behavior of software packages being compiled. Often, however, upon configuration there's an option
called '--prefix', which allow us to set the installation path. There's also usually another option called '--enable-local' that 
allow us to install software in the folder of download. In any case, the point is that it's preferable to install software not in
the 'usr' folder in general, unless we're certain about what we're doing. If so, then usr/local/bin is the place to install for 
compiled from source software.
