The root of the file system starts at '/'. 

The 'cd' command is used for changing directory. The command cd - returns us back to the last working directory we were at.

We have the following main folders in a linux files system:
/       This is the root of your filesystem, where everything begins.

/etc    This directory contains system configuration files.

/home   This is the default home directory for all users (except the root user).

/root   This is the home directory for the root user.

/dev    This is where your devices such as your hard disks, USB drives, and optical drives reside on your system.

/opt    This is where you can install additional 3rd party software (This is not clear to me. For example, in Debian it seems
        like a software is being installed in user/bin rather!)

/bin    This is where essential binaries (programs) reside on your system.

/sbin   This is where system binaries (programs) that are typically used by the system administrator are stored.

/tmp    This is where temporary files are stored; they are usually deleted after a system reboot, so never store important files 
        here!

/var    This directory contains files that may change in size, such as mail spools and log files.

/boot   All the files required for your system to boot are stored here.

/lib    This directory contains libraries needed by the essential binaries in the /bin and /sbin directories. A library is 
        basically a set of precompiled functions that can be used by a program.

/proc   This is where information about running processes is stored.

/usr    This directory contains files and utilities that are shared between users.
