The touch command has two functionalities:

1- To change the last modification time of a folder (whatever that is useful for.)
2- For creating an empty file.

Consequently, 'touch folder_path' is an example of the first, and 'touch file.txt' as an example of the second.

Note that touch naturally changes the access time of a file as well. To only change the modification time, we can pass the -m
option. To change the access time only, use the 'a' option.

We can get more adventurous with the touch command as well.

$ touch {mama,papa}_file.txt   # Interpolates with these two. Note that a space would imply a new line, making
                               # files  {mama, papa}_file.txt LoL!
$ touch file_{a...z}.txt       # Creates files a through z
$ touch {00..99..10}.txt       # Start, stop (inclusive), step formula. 
$ touch {000..100..2}.txt

Note that these are the magic of curly braces. We can use them with other commands as well.
