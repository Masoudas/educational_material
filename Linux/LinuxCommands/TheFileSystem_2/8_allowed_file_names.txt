Essentially, every character is allowed in linux as part of a file name, except for the reserved forward slash:

$ touch @#$%^*()_-=+    # Ok!
$ touch /   # Error! Can't change the modification time of the root folder!

Note that:
    -   File names are case sensitive
    -   Of course, they have to be unique inside a folder.
