This is very interesting! There's a stack for keeping paths in the shell! We can push and pop in this stack with
the pushd and popd commands, and use dirs to see the content of this stack.

In fact popd, takes right there (it has a built in 'cd' inside of it!)

We can use pushd as follows:
$ pushd +3 	# Rotates the stack and brings n-th element to the top.

We can use 'popd +n' to pop the n-th element of the stack.
