Package managers are programs that we use in Linux to manage packages; that is, to download, install, remove, 
search, and update packages. Keep in mind that different Linux distributions have different package managers. 
For example, dpkg, which stands for Debian package manager, is the package manager for Ubuntu and other 
Debian-based Linux distributions. On the other hand, RedHat-based Linux distributions like Fedora and CentOS use 
rpm, which stands for RedHat Package Manager. Other Linux distributions like SUSE use zypper as the package manager 
and so on.

Very rarely will you find experienced Linux users going to a website to download a software package as Windows 
or macOS users do. Instead, each Linux distribution has its list of sources from where it gets the majority of 
its software packages. These sources are also referred to as repositories.
