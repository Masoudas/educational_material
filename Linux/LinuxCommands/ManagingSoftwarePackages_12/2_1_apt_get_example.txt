On Ubuntu and other Debian Linux distributions, you can use the command-line utility apt-get to manage packages. 
Behind the scenes, apt-get makes use of the package manager dpkg. To download a package, you can run the command 
apt-get download followed by the package name:

# Change to a directory like tmp to download
$ su -
$ cd /tmp
$ apt-get download cmatrix code

And as such, the debian package is downloaded. We can list the content of the package using -c option, which
stands for content using the dpkg command

$ dpkg -c cmatrix
drwxr-xr-x root/root     0 2018-04-03 06:17 ./
drwxr-xr-x root/root     0 2018-04-03 06:17 ./usr/
drwxr-xr-x root/root     0 2018-04-03 06:17 ./usr/bin/
-rwxr-xr-x root/root 18424 2018-04-03 06:17 ./usr/bin/cmatrix
drwxr-xr-x root/root     0 2018-04-03 06:17 ./usr/share/
...

Notice that everything is ready to be installed directly in the usr folder as we expected.

To install a package of course we need to use the -i option.
