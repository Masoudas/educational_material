We can remove files using the rm command. For recursive removal (which involves the folders inside the given path), we need to use 
rm.

Note again that to remove the content of the directory, and not the directory itself, we need only to add the /*.

An interesting option in rm is -i, which makes the command interactive. rm -f forces remove of sensititve files.
There's of course the recursive option -r for removing directories.
