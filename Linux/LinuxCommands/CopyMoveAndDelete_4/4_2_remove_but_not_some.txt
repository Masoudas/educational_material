A question that we always encounter is how can we remove all files except some? There are a couple of easy answers
to this:

	-	Using glob
Normally, we first need to enable extra globe options (more than ?, * and [::].) To that end, what we can do is to
use the following command:
$ shopt -s extglob	# On my machine, however, extglob is on by default.

Now, we these additional globs available:
*(pattern-list) – matches zero or more occurrences of the specified patterns
?(pattern-list) – matches zero or one occurrence of the specified patterns
+(pattern-list) – matches one or more occurrences of the specified patterns
@(pattern-list) – matches one of the specified patterns
!(pattern-list) – matches anything except one of the given patterns

So now, let's say we wanted not remove CMakeLists.txt, but anything other than that.
$ rm -rv !(CMakeLists.txt)	# Anything but.

Now, it's suggested to turn extglob of after the given removal:
$ shopt -s extglob


	-	Using find:
To remove a particular set of files, use the 'find' command. An example is:
$ find . -f -not -name 'something.txt' -delete
$ find . -type f -not \(-name '*gz' -or -name '*odt' -or -name '*.jpg' \) -delete
