To copy a file, we need only to use the cp command, where the structure is 'cp source destination'

Note that we can change the name of the copied filed by assigning a name 'cp file1 path/file2'

We can also copy multiple files into a new folder.

To copy a directory together with its contents, we need to use the -r flag. Note that there are two cases here:
1- If you want this directory to be copied, including the directory name, use the command 'cp -r dir1 dir2'.
2- If you want the CONTENT of the be copied, and not its folder name, use the command 'cp -r dir/* dir2'
Note that by content, we mean only the files inside this folder. If there's folder like dir1 inside dir, it will not be copied,
the command line warns about it, and only the files will be copied.

Note that same as with files, we can copy multiple directories or their content into a new one.
We can't copy into multiple destinations however.

Note: We can supply the target with -t. Note however the point is that we can list as many files as we want,
but so long as the destination is a folder, we're fine:

$ cp file1 file2 file3 folder   # If last argument is a folder, we're file.
