Before we start, note that if the destination file already exists, the copy command does not create a new file.
Moreover, the permissions are not overridden. As such, if the destination file belongs to the root, we can't 
copy to it with a normal user copy! In other words, the copy command does not copy or mess with the permissions
if they already exist. Only when we create the new file that the permissions are copied.

Moreover, recall that lack of execution permission implies not being able to copy a new file (or use it for 
execution with any other command for that matter.)
