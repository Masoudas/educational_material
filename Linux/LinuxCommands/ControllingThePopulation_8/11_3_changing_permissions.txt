To change the permissions of a file, we can use the chmod command.

$ chmod o+w filename # Change the write permission of others to allow write.

Using the help option, we can see that we have the followng modes. Note that this is written in regex, meaning
zero or more of ugoa, then one or more of -+= etc. But then there's a | meaning or use -+= with 0 to 7.
Note that based on this, we can't say for example 'ug-wgx'.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
'[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'  
    # Note that a means all or everyone. 
    # = is used to explictly state the permissions


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Examples:
$ chmod og+x filename
$ chmod g=rwx filename  # Allow read, write and execute to the group.
$ chmod a= filename     # Gives zero permission


Now, note that each group permision is a base eight value, starting from 0 to 7 corresponding to _ _ _. Hence:
    -   1 means only execution privilege
    -   4 means only read
    -   7 means all 
    -   0 means none

Hence we can change permission in the format (ugo)_8. 

Examples:
$ chmod 011 filename # Group and others can execute.
$ chmod 070 filename # Allow read, write execute to the group
$ chmod 000 filename # Give zero permission   

Note that just like the chown command, we can change the content of a folder recursively using the -R command:

$ chmod -R 755 dir
