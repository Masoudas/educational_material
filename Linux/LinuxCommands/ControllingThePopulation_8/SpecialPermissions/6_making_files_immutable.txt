All the permissions including the uid, gid, and sticky bit are common among all file systems.

There's another set of permissions that are present with ext2, 3 and 4 file systems. These are called extended
attributes.

An important extended attribute is 'i', which makes the file immutable. If the file is immutable, its content
cannot change. We use chattr command to do so:

$ chattr +i	file_name	# Set the attribute
$ chattr -i	file_name	# Unset the attribute.

When a file is immutable, essentially its like x=0 and w=0, and we can't write to it or change it.
