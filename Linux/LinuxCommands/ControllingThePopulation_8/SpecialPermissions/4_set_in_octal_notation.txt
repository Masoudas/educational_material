So imagine there's a separate octal associated with uid, gid and sticky bit. This one comes as the first bit.
Hence, 1 sets the sticky bit, 2 sets the gid, 4 sets the uid bit. Hence for example, 7 sets all, 6 sets uid
and gid.

$ chmod 7777 file   # All permissions
$ chmod 6777 file   # No sticky

Now, to remove suid or guid or sticky bit, we need to append as many zeroes, which is kind of odd! Otherwise,
we can use the "ug-s -t" flag:

$ chmod 00755 file  # Remove the flags guid and sticky bit.
$ chmod 000755 file # Remove all flags
$ chmod 0755 file # Only the sticky bit.
