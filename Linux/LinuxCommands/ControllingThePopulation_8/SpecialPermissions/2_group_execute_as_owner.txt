SGID is similar to SUID. With the SGID bit set, any user executing the file will have same permissions as the 
group owner of the file.

Itâ€™s benefit is in handling the directory. When SGID permission is applied to a directory, all sub directories 
and files created inside this directory will get the same group ownership as main directory (not the group 
ownership of the user that created the files and directories.)

In fact, whenever a user creates a file and a folder, they're the owner of it (and their default gid is the
group.) Giving the group permission ensures that whenever they create another file or folder inside, the gid
is set to the group of the folder, not the user that created it. Note that this not the case with SUID however.

$ ls -ld /var/local

Set permission with g+s
