Every file in Linux is owned by a specific user and a specific group. We can demonstrate this by long listing a 
folder.
                (1)      (2)
-rw-r--r-- 1 masoudas masoudas 3834 mars  10 09:51 .bashrc

    (1): user id
    (2): group id

A file has a group id, because it must have been made by a particular user, which has a primary group.

Note: File ownership can only be changed by the super user (or using sudo,) because a user may not be able to
change the ownership of other files, and also if a user wants to change the ownership of his files to super user
for example, he won't be able to do that.
A user however may change the permissions of his files, naturally to grant himself or others access to the file.
