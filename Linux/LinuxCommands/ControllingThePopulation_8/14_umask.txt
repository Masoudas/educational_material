On Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, new files are created with a default set of permissions. 
Specifically, a new file's permissions may be restricted in a specific way by applying a permissions "mask" called 
the umask. The umask command is used to set this mask, or to show you its current value.

The mask is set just-line a normal mod, but its interpretation is inversed:
$ umask 0002

This implies that the write permission for others is masked. So when files are created, they have permissions 
which allow write permission for the user (file owner). The rest of the file's permissions would be unchanged from 
the operating system default. 

As another example:
$ umask 700
$ touch file
$ ls -l file
----rw-rw- 1 masoudas masoudas 0 ao√ªt  13 17:21 a

Note that with no arguments, umask displays the current mask, or with -S as string.
