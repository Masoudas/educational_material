We can remove a user simply using the command 'userdel user_name'.  Such a delete does not remove the home directory of the user, which is a good thing!

To remove the home directory of the deleted user, we need to make the deletion recursive:
    --remove-home             remove the users home directory and mail spool
    --remove-all-files        remove all files owned by user
    --backup                  backup files before removing.
    --backup-to <DIR>         target directory for the backups.
                              Default is the current directory.
    --system                  only remove if system user
