Question: Suppose we give no permission on anything to any user. Question is, can the superuser still do everything
with a file, including read, write and execute?
Note that to give no permission for a file, we should 
$ chmod -a= file

Answer: The root in such a case:
    -   can read this file and write to it.
    -   can't execute this file.

To allow the root to execute the file, any of the execution permission should be set. Hence, the root can change 
the permission of execution for a user that owns a file!
