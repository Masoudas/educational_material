In Linux, user information is stored in the /etc/passwd file. Every line in /etc/passwd corresponds to exactly one
user. (Me: The actuall encrypted password is stored in the file 'shadow' in the same folder.)

When we first open this file, we see lots of different users. These are services which are part of linux. System user 
however are the main focus here, as they're the real world users of linux.

An entry for a system user looks something like this:
    1       2   3   4          5            6               7 
masoud_user:x:1000:1000:masoud sharbaf:/home/masoud_user:/bin/bash

Each field is explained below:
    1   This field stores the username.

    2   This field usually has an 'x' in it, which means the user's password is encrypted and stored in the file 
        /etc/shadow.

    3   This field stores the UID (User ID) number.

    4   This field stores the primary GID (Group ID) of the user.

    5   This field stores a comment on the user, which is usually the user's first and last name.

    6   This field stores the path of the user's home directory.

    7   This field stores the user's default shell.
