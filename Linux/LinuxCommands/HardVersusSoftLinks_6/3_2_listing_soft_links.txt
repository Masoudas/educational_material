As we already know, when listing files, soft links are prepended with -l. So, we can use grep to list soft links
like so:

$ ls | grep "^l"

We can also use the type in find to list only soft links:

$ find . --max-depth=1 -type l (-maxdepth=1?)

Finally, to show what a link refers to, we can either use ls -l, or readlink:
$ readlink link_file
