So, every file has a unique index in Linux, and contains attributes such as type, permission, timestamp, size, owner.

An innode (or index node) is a structure that holds these information. Formally:

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Inode:

An inode is simply a file data structure that stores file information (attributes), and every inode is uniquely identified by a 
number (inode number).
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Note that file name is not part of the innode, but when using the stat command, it will be shown on top of the innode.
