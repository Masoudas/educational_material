Note that the su command has to modes:
    - su user_name  (keep current environment setting)
    - su - user_name (lose current environment setting. Essentially, minus current setting)

What's the difference: When you don't add the dash before the username, the shell preserves the current user shell environment 
settings, which includes the current working directory. On the other hand, when you add the dash, the shell acquires the 
environment settings of the new user (the user you switched to).

Consequently, 'su -' switches to the root, dropping the current environment settings.
