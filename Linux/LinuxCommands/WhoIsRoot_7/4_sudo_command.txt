The man page for sudo command states that:

    -   sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the 
        security policy.  The invoking user's real (not effective) user-ID is used to determine the user name with 
        which to query the security policy.

More specifically, sudo means 'switch user + do.' As an example, we can say:
$ sudo -u masoud id    # Switch user to masoudas and do.
$ sudo id              # Switch user to root and do.
