By writing sudo -i, we can switch to the root. Note the difference in the name of the user:

Before typing the command 'sudo -i':
masoud_user@DESKTOP-F76HM9S:~$

After writing the command 'sudo -i':
root@DESKTOP-F76HM9S:~#

Note that we have the usual 'user_name@hostname:pwd'. Note also that after punching in the command, pwd is ~. What is this ~?
It's the home directory of the root, which is /root.

After switching to root (or superuser,) we're allowed to create files and folders on the root.

Recall also that by typing su, we can switch back to a normal user. Moreover, exit does the same job. Finally, su root switches 
to the root as well.

Note that running the su command without the root will also change to root!

Note also that we can say 'sudo su -', which is essentially equivalent to 'sudo su - root', and it will take us to the how folder
of root.
