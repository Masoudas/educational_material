A Question that may arise while installing Ubuntu in particular is that is the first user installed root?

The answer I found over the internet is that:
    -   No, the user created during the installation process of Ubuntu is not root. Every Linux installation has a 
        root user, but it's not recommended to use it for everyday work. Because root is allowed to do basically 
        anything, it's very easy to wreck your system with a small oversight. Therefore, most (if not all) Linux 
        distributions offer to create a "normal", non-privileged user during the installation process. It's 
        recommended to use that user for everyday work, and only change to the all powerful root when you 
        actually need to.

        Ubuntu even goes a step further: In a standard Ubuntu installation, root doesn't have a password. Because 
        of that, you can't open a session as root. If you need roots power, you use the sudo command instead.

        sudo (an abbrevation for "switch user and do") executes the command that follows as another user. 
        For example ls /some/directory is done with the user account you're logged in with. sudo -u joe 
        ls /some/directory is done with the user joe and it's privileges.

        If you don't specify a user name, sudo assumes root. Therefore, sudo ls /some/directory would execute 
        ls /some/directory with the privileges of root.
