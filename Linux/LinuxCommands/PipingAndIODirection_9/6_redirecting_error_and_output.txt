So far, we saw that the normal output of a command can be redirected using file descriptor one, and the error
messages with file descriptor 2. Now, normally a command has both of these outputs, so the question would be how
can we direct both outputs?

Obviously, if we wanted to add them to separate files, we could do as follows:

$ command 1> output_file 2> error_file

Now, if we wanted both output to go the same file, assuming both files exist before hand, we can do:

$ touch all_output
$ command 1 >> all_output 2>> all_output

Now, another solution here would be to get output 2, and stream it to output one, naturally. To do so, we can't 
write 2>1, which would imply create a file 1 and put output 2 in it. Instead, we say 2 should be streamed to a
REFERENCE to output one, as follows:

$ command 1>all_output 2>&1
