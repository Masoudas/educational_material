Question: What's the difference between the following two commands:

$ find . -name *.txt | grep stream
$ find . -name *.txt | xargs grep stream - # Or without the dash

Answer:
So note that the first one directly prints to stdout. Hence, we grep the string stream inside each line of 
the output. Hence, it will find text files that have stream as part of their names.

In the second one we say first, write the output string in xargs, then evaluate the result. This implies that
the second command becomes something like:

$ grep stream /path/file.txt
Hence, it will actually look inside the content of the file! Cool.

Note: Possibly, this version is a bit faster:
$ find . -name *.txt -print0 | xargs -0 grep stream

Note: We should once again be reminded here that without -0, each line of stdout is passed to xargs with a space,
hence it would be interpreted as independent arguments. On the other hand, with -0, we pass all of stdout as a
single argument, with -0 separating them.
