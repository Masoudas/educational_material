Here's something to note about piping. In a pipe, the previous command fully executes, then the entire result is
passed to the next command in the pipe to be executed. In other words, it's not like a single line gets executed,
then we pass it to the next line and so on and so forth. For example, consider the following command:

$ ls -l --time-style=long-iso | awk ' BEGIN { getline; } { print $9 } ' | sort | xargs md5sum 	# Calculates md5
# of all the files in this folder.

Now, what happens here is that first, all the files are listed with ls. Then from all of that chunk of data, all
of their ninth column is taken, then all of those ninth column are sorted, then the md5sum of all of those files
are calculated. Then, from all those md5sums, the ones with unique first 32 letters are chosen.

What does not happen here is that we print the first file line, then we pass that line to awk, then that line
is passed to sort, etc.

In a pipe, every command is fully executed before passing the result to the next line.
