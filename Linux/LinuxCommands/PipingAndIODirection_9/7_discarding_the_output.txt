Sometimes, we just want to discard the output of a command, and neither show either the error messages nor the
output. What we can do in this situation is to stream the output into the /dev/null file, which I like to call
the blackhole of linux (or more precisely, the garbage collector of linux):

$ ls non_existent 2> /dev/null
