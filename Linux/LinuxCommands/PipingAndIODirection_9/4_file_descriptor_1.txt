The standard output (stdout) is linked to file descriptor 1.

WHAT IS A FILE DESCRIPTOR?

    A file descriptor is a number that uniquely identifies an open file in a computer's operating system.

Therefore, running the command:

$ date > mydate.txt

is equivalent to running the following command:

% date 1> mydate.txt

Notice that the 1 in 1> references file descriptor 1 (stdout).
