Now, using the read command, we can stream the content of a file as follows:

$ read weather < weather_file

There's however a subtle point to remember. When we reach the end of each line, we have a carriage return, or an
\n. Can we put the entire content of a file in a variable? At this point, I'm not sure. But if we could, we could
then use a piping as "tail -n m weather_file | head -n 1" to read every line of the file, where m is a variable.
