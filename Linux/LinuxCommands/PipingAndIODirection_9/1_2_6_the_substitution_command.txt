The substitution command $() acts in the same manner as xargs:

$ ls $(echo "/")    # lists /. Equivalent to echo "/" | ls
$ echo $(ls /)      # Echos the result of the list.

When performing substitution, it's important to note that if we have a new line or space, then the string to be
substituted will have a problem. Hence, we better surround the substitution expression with quotes (although I
must admit this has no effect in my Linux Bash, and everything is preserved and no errors are thrown!)
