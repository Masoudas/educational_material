We know that if a command is surrounded by $(), then it's result is placed in the current line and then it's 
executed. So we can assign to a variable with it:

var=$(ls -l)

Now, without the $, only the command is executed in a subshell and no replacemet in the current shell occurs. 
Moreover, the subshell changes are not reflected in the original shell.

$ pwd
/
$ (cd /bin ; ls -la)
...
$ pwd
/	# no changes
