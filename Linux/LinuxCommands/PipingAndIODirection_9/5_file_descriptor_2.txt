Note that errors cannot be directed to files using > or >> (or more precisely 1> or 1>>.) For example, suppose we type

$ more non_existent_file > f
more: stat of non_existent_file failed: No such file or directory

This message is not directed to the file. To actually stream this error message into the file, we need use file
descriptor 2 as follows:

$ more non_existent_file 2> f
