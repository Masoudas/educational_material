Say we' have the following shell script:

%%%%%
#!/bin/bash
echo $*'#'
%%%%%
This script prints all the arguments and a # after them.

Now, say we wanted to use the arguments to format them, to execute a command as follows, once by all args,
once by only two, and once one by one:

%% one by one
./script arg1 
./script arg2 
./script arg3

%% at most two 
./script arg1 arg2 
./script arg3

%% all together
./script arg1 arg2 arg3

Moreover, suppose that all the arguments are in a file. So how to de we go about supplying them to our
script as we just said?

The first thing that I always forget is that there's no such thing as fstream in shell, and a cat command
is enough to read a file and print it ont stdout. As such, we can use xargs to format our text:

$ cat arguments_file | xargs ./script	# Makes all arguments into one line and passes it.
$ cat arguments_file | xargs -n 2 ./script	# At most two per execution
$ cat arguments_file | xargs -n 1 ./script

Especially, if we substitute script with the tiny script we showed above, we will see the effect.
