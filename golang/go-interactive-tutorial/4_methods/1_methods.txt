/*
Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types. A method is a function with a special receiver argument. The receiver appears in its own argument list between the func keyword and the method name. In this example, the Abs method has a receiver of type Vertex named v.

Me: The syntax is important:
func (var Struct_type) functionName(other_args) return_type {
}

In essence, a method is just a function.
