/* Note that when defining an array, we have the syntax:
	[](type){initialization in bracket}

That is why, we may define an array of implicity defined structs, as given below:

s := []struct {
		i int
		b bool
	}{
		{2, true},
		{},
		{x:},
	}

Notice that the second curly braces indicat the initialization of the implicitly define structs.

Here's an array of slices:

board := [][]string{
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
	}
