We may be wondering if it matters that we get the configuration exactly right at this point, since we can always 
change it as discussed? 

The answer depends on the way we anticipate using it. If we plan to create a new toolchain for each target, then it 
makes sense to set everything up at the beginning, because it will reduce the risks of getting it wrong later on. 
Jumping ahead a little to Chapter 6, Selecting a Build System, we call this the Buildroot philosophy. If, on the 
other hand, we want to build a toolchain that is generic and we are prepared to provide the correct settings when 
we build for a particular target, then we should make the base toolchain generic, which is the way the Yocto Project 
handles things. The preceding examples follow the Buildroot philosophy.
