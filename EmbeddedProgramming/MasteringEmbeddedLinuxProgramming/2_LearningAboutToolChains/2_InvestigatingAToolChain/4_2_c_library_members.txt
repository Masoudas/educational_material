The C library is not a single library file. It is composed of four main parts that together implement the 
POSIX API:

-   libc 
    The main C library that contains the well-known POSIX functions such as printf, open, close, read, write, 
    and so on.

-   libm
    Contains maths functions such as cos, exp, and log.

-   libpthread 
    Contains all the POSIX thread functions with names beginning with pthread_

-   librt 
    Has the real-time extensions to POSIX, including shared memory and asynchronous I/O


Note: These libraries appear to be in the sysroot as dlls.

Note: Note that the C libraries as discussed are in "sysroot/usr/lib". I bring your attention to the fact that there's
libc.a and libc.so. The first one is the static version, whereas the second one is the dynamic version.

The first one, libc, is always linked in but the others have to be explicitly linked with the -l option. The 
parameter to -l is the library name with lib stripped off. For example, a program that calculates a sine function by 
calling sin() would be linked with libm using -lm. (Me: recall that include path is done using -I)
