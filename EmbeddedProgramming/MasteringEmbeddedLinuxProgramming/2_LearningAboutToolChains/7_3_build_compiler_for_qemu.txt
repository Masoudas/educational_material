While it's true that qemu is a system emulator, still, we need to build compilers for it. This is because, well, we
need to compile code for it like we do any other machines.

Now, the closest target that we can find for arm on qemu is apparently arm-linux-abi. Using the same procedure as 
the one for arm-cortexa8, we can build a new compiler for here as well.

Note that for this build, we only remove the option to make chain read-only in menuconfig, and don't change the 
float passing option.
