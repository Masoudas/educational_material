As usuall, with any C program, we can compile it using the corresponding gcc compiler as follows:

$ arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabi-gcc -g main.cpp -o app

Note that -g means we want configuration to be debug, which hinges on installing gdb. After the binary has been 
generated, we can check the ELF header of the file using the file command:

$ file app
helloworld: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), 
for GNU/Linux 4.3.0, not stripped

To further verify that the app is not executed on the host machine, we can go ahead and execute it, in which case we
get an error like:
bash: ./first_embedded_app: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
