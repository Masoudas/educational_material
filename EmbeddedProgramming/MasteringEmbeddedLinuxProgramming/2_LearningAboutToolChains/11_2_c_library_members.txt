The C library is not a single library file. It is composed of four main parts that together implement the 
POSIX API:

-   libc 
    The main C library that contains the well-known POSIX functions such as printf, open, close, read, write, 
    and so on.

-   libm
    Contains maths functions such as cos, exp, and log.

-   libpthread 
    Contains all the POSIX thread functions with names beginning with pthread_

-   librt 
    Has the real-time extensions to POSIX, including shared memory and asynchronous I/O


Note: These libraries appear to be in the sysroot as dlls.

The first one, libc, is always linked in but the others have to be explicitly linked with the -l option. The 
parameter to -l is the library name with lib stripped off. For example, a program that calculates a sine function by 
calling sin() would be linked with libm using -lm. (Me: recall that include path is done using -I)
