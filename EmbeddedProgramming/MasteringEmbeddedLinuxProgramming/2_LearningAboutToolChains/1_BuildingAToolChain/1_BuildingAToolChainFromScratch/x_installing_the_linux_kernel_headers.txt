Note that for compiler to be able to compile for linux, I need to have the header files for the linux kernel. These headers need to be included inside the
include folder of the compiler (say compiler is installed at /usr/local/compiler, then the kernel headers are put at /usr/local/compiler/include.)

In particular, I need three sets of headers from the linux kernel:
-   asm (this could be asm-cpu_architecture)
-   asm-generic
-   linux

So, how do I obtain these headers? Note that these headers are not dependent on the distribution of the linux kernel (Debian ...), and not on the processor
architecture. The header files are just there to introduce the libraries, and dynamic linking takes care of that.

To obtain the headers, first, I need to download a version of the kernel, which I can find at kernel.org. I put "download linux kernel".
Once downloaded, there's the always present rules for making.

I need to run the following commands:

cd linux-kernel
make mrproper
make ARCH=arm integrator_defconfig  # arm is the architecture we're building for. Note that this is not GNU, hence, we just need to tell the architectur.
make ARCH=arm headers_check
make ARCH=arm INSTALL_HDR_PATH=$SOMEWHERE headers_install   # Somewhere is the location where the header files will be installed. This would then be 
                                                            # /usr/local/compiler/include.

And the easiest part of the lot is done!
