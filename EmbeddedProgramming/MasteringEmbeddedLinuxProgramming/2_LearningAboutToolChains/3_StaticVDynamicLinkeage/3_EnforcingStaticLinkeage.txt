To enforce that all linkeage be static, we can use the -static option for a binary. In that case, the linkeage
will be done statically.

$ arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -static -g main.cpp -o main-static

Now, using 'ls -lh' to get a long humanly readable listing of the both statically linked and dynamically linked, we
see that:

-rwxrwxr-x 1 masoudas masoudas  14K mars  13 11:53 main
-rwxrwxr-x 1 masoudas masoudas 2,8M mars  13 11:55 main-static

We see that the statically linked executable far exceeds the size of the dynamically linked program.

Reminder: static linkeage can be enforced only in the case where there's a static version of every library available
to us.
