As mentioned earlier, libc contains the most basic OS POSIX operations such as printf, etc.. Any application you 
write for Linux, whether it be in C or C++, will be linked with the C library libc. This is so fundamental that you 
don't even have to tell gcc or g++ to do it because it always links libc. Other libraries that you may want to link 
with have to be explicitly named through the -l option.

My Note: In case of C++, the standard libraries have to be linked with -std option. An example for compiling a file 
main.cpp would be:
$ g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o app
