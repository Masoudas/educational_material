This is my estimation, but the discussion we just had was about run-time linkeage. But one might ask, how can we 
link to older versions of the library at compile time?

The answer probably is this. The older library is put in a separate folder, then using the -L and -l options, we
find its location and link to it. In such a case, the link file (for example libjpeg.so like in the previous discussion) 
is compiled with the version we intend.
