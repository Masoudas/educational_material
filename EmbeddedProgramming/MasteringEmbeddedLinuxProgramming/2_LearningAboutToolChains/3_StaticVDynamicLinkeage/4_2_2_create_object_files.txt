To create object files that are suitable to be placed in a shared library, the object code for a shared library must 
be position-independent, so that the runtime linker is free to locate it in memory at the next free address. To do 
this, add the -fPIC parameter to gcc, where
    -  PIC stands for Position Independent Code. See next a discussion on position independent code.
    -  f probably stands for flag, but no one knows. 

$ arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -fPIC -c test1.c test2.c   # Generates test1.o, test2.o that are position 
                                                            # independent.
