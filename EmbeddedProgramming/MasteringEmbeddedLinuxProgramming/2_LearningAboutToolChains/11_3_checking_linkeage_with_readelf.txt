Using the 'readelf' tool from the toolchain, we can read the ELF header to check which dlls are linked to the file. 

"""
$ arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabihf-readelf -a my_program | grep "Shared library"
"""

An example output would be:
$ arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabihf-readelf -a my_program | grep "Shared library"
0x00000001 (NEEDED) Shared library: [libm.so.6]     // Meaning uses libm version 6 dll.
0x00000001 (NEEDED) Shared library: [libc.so.6]     // Meaning uses libc version 6 dll.


Shared libraries need a runtime linker, which we can expose using:
"""
$ arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabihf-readelf -a myprog | grep "program interpreter"
"""

[Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3]
