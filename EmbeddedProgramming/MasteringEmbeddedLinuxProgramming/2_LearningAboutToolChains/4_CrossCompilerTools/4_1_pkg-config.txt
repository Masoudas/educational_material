Keeping track of the dependencies of a package and their required installation flags is a quite difficult task.
The package configuration utility pkg-config (https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) helps track 
which packages are installed and which compile flags each needs by keeping a database of Autotools packages in 
[sysroot]/usr/lib/pkgconfig.

For instance, the one for SQLite3 is named sqlite3.pc and contains essential information needed by other packages 
that need to make use of it.

Essentially, pkg-config does what the cmake scripts of a cmake project do. They contain the flags and the information
we need to bind to a library.
