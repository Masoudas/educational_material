autotool is a GNU build tool, which consists of the following subpackages:
    - GNU Autoconf 
    - GNU Automake
    - GNU Libtool
    - Gnulib


The role of Autotools is to smooth over the differences between the many different types of systems that the 
package may be compiled for, accounting for different versions of compilers, different versions of libraries, 
different locations of header files, and dependencies with other packages. Packages that use Autotools come with a 
script named configure that checks dependencies and generates makefiles according to what it finds. The configure 
script may also give you the opportunity to enable or disable certain features. You can find the options on offer 
by running: 

$ ./configure --help.
