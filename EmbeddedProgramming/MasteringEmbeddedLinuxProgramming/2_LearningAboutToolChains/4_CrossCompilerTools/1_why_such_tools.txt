At some point, we want to start cross-compiling many tools and libraries for our target system. Many of them will 
be open source packagesâ€”each of which has its own method of compiling and its own peculiarities. There are some 
common build systems, including:
    - Pure makefiles, where the toolchain is usually controlled by the make variable CROSS_COMPILE
    - The GNU build system known as Autotools
    - CMake
