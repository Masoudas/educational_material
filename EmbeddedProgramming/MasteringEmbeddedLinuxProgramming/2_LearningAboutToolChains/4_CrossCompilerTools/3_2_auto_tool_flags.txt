After typing in $./configure --help, we get the following list of options, which are pretty much self-explanatory.
There are actually many more options, but I bring the most important ones here:

  --prefix=PREFIX install architecture-independent files in PREFIX [/usr/local]
  --build=BUILD     configure for building on BUILD [guessed]
  --host=HOST       cross-compile to build programs to run on HOST [BUILD]

  INSTALL     Specify the full path to a BSD-compatible install
  CC          C compiler command
  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>
  LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
  CPPFLAGS    (Objective) C/C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
              you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
  CXX         C++ compiler command
  CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
  CPP         C preprocessor
  YACC        The `Yet Another Compiler Compiler' implementation to use.
              Defaults to the first program found out of: `bison -y', `byacc',
              `yacc'.

And many more address to programs like AWK, BASH, etc.

For example, to change the C compiler, we use the famous CC option (no idea why they put it before ./configure.
probably fine to put it after too.)
$ CC=arm-cortex_a8-linux-gnueabihf ./configure -CFLAGS="-Iusr/local/include" -LDFLAG="-lopencv"
