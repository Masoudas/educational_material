The toolchain sysroot is a directory which contains subdirectories for libraries, header files, and other 
configuration files. It can be set when the toolchain is configured through --with-sysroot=, or it can be set on the 
command line using --sysroot=. You can see the location of the default sysroot by using -print-sysroot.

We see the following folders in sysroot:

    -   lib: Contains the shared objects for the C library and the dynamic linker/loader, ld-linux
    -   usr/lib, the static library archive files for the C library, and any other libraries that may be installed 
        subsequently
    -   usr/include: Contains the headers for all the libraries
    -   usr/bin: Contains the utility programs that run on the target, such as the ldd command
    -   use/share: Used for localization and internationalization
    -   sbin: Provides the ldconfig utility, used to optimize library loading paths

Plainly, some of these are needed on the development host to compile programs, and others - for example, the shared 
libraries and ld-linux - are needed on the target at runtime.
