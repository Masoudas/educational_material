Most embedded x86/x86_64 designs (me: I think intell), and some ARM designs, have firmware based on the Universal 
Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard. You can take a look at the UEFI website at http://www.uefi.org/ 
for more information. The boot sequence is fundamentally the same as that described in the preceding section:

    -   Phase I: 
    The processor loads the platform initialization firmware from flash memory. In some designs, it is loaded 
    directly from NOR flash memory, while in others, there is ROM code on-chip which loads the firmware from 
    SPI flash memory into some on-chip static RAM. (me: This is equivalent to the SD card phase in the previous
    section. Hence, we're past the ROM stage at this point.)

    -   Phase II:
    The platform initialization firmware performs the role of SPL. It initializes the DRAM controller and other 
    system interfaces, so as to be able to load an EFI boot manager from the EFI System Partition (ESP) on a 
    local disk, or from a network server via PXE boot. The ESP must be formatted using FAT16 or FAT32 format and 
    it should have the well-known GUID value of C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B. The path name of the boot 
    manager code must follow the naming convention <efi_system_partition>/boot/boot<machine_type_short_name>.efi.
    For example, the file path to the loader on an x86_64 system would be /efi/boot/bootx64.efi.
    (Note: See LinuxFundamentals/StorageParitionMount chapter on MBR vs GUID and what the identifier is.)
    (Note: running df -h, we can see that efi of linux is on /boot/efi as a matter of fact. We can ls to see
    all the efi files used when booting on my PC. Apparently, the ROM program is capable of loading directly from
    my hard drive.)

    -   Phase III:
    The UEFI boot manager is the tertiary program loader. The TPL in this case has to be a bootloader that is 
    capable of loading a Linux kernel and an optional RAM disk into memory. Common choices are:
        -   systemd-boot: This used to be called gummiboot. It is a simple UEFI-compatible bootloader, 
            licensed under LGPL v2.1. The website is https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/.
        -   Tummiboot: This is the gummiboot with trusted boot support (Intel's Trusted Execution Technology 
            (TEX)).

    Note: The arm community says that UEFI can be just a replacement for U-boot.
