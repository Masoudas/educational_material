The operating system needs to know information about the hardware when it starts to boot up, otherwise, it cannot
connect to the CPU or memory, or do other things. The way to provide this information for ARM and FreeScale MPS
processors is through something called the device tree.

As the official documentation of device tree at www.devicetree.org specifies:

"DTSpec specifies a construct called adevicetreeto describe system hardware.  A boot program loads a devicetree 
into a client programâ€™s memory and passes a pointer to the devicetree to the client."

Note that we may not find the EXACT device tree for a device, hence we generally need to find the closest one,
and possibly add information in there.
