Each node in the device tree has properties that describe the characteristics of the node. Properties consist of a 
name and a value.

-   Property names: character sets such as:
        -   compatible (discussed next), 
        -   part-number (discussed next),
        -   version (discussed next)
    
    Example:
    fsl,channel-fifo-lenibm,
    ppc-interrupt-server#slinux,
    network-index

-   Propery values: Value of properties, which fall in the following categories:
    -   <empty>     For conveying true or false.
    -   <u32>       A 32 bit number. A 32-bit integer in big-endian format.  
                    Example: the 32-bit value 0x11223344 wouldbe represented in memory as:
                    address    11
                    address+1  22
                    address+2  33
                    address+3  44
                    (ME: by address in memory we mean the value of this propery, which as we can see is in big
                    endian format. So where the device tree is written in memory.)
    -   <u64>       Same as 32, but 64.
    -   <phandle>   A <u32> value. A phandle value is a way to reference another node in the device tree. Any node 
                    that can be referenced defines a phandle property with a unique<u32>value. That number is used 
                    for the value of properties with a phandle value type.
    -   <stringlist> Several strings.

Example: 
/dts-v1/;
/{                                          # Root node
    model = "TI AM335x BeagleBone";         # Property (of parent node)
    compatible = "ti,am33xx";               # Property
    #address-cells = <1>;                   # Property
    #size-cells = <1>;      
    cpus {                                  # child of root
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        cpu@0 {
            compatible = "arm,cortex-a8";
            device_type = "cpu";
            reg = <0>;
        };
    };
    memory@0x80000000 {
        device_type = "memory";
        reg = <0x80000000 0x20000000>; /* 512 MB */
    };
};
