U-Boot, or to give its full name, Das U-Boot, began life as an open source bootloader for embedded PowerPC boards. 
Then, it was ported to ARM-based boards and later to other architectures, including MIPS and SH. It is hosted and 
maintained by Denx Software Engineering. There is plenty of information available, and a good place to start is 
http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot. There is also a mailing list at u-boot@lists.denx.de.

Download the git project, and possibly checkout a version or branch you're interested in. In this example, I
checkout version v2017.01.

$ git checkout v2017.01

There are more than 1,000 configuration files for common development boards and devices in the configs/ directory. 
In most cases, you can make a good guess of which to use, based on the filename, but you can get more detailed 
information by looking through the per-board README files in the board/ directory, or you can find information in 
an appropriate web tutorial or forum.
