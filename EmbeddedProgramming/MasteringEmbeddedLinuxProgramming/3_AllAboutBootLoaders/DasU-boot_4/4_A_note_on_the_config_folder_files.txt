So when we go inside of the config folder on the 2021 master branch, we see the following config files for
just am335, which is the board for boneblack:


Now, inside each of these files, there's a whole range of options beginning with the word CONFIG_. According
to the README on the root folder of u-boot:

""""""""""
There are two classes of configuration variables:

* Configuration _OPTIONS_:
  These are selectable by the user and have names beginning with
  "CONFIG_".
* Configuration _SETTINGS_:
  These depend on the hardware etc. and should not be meddled with if
  you don't know what you're doing; they have names beginning with
  "CONFIG_SYS_".
""""""""""

Hence, we can customize the boot with these CONFIG_ options. Here's for example the content of 
am335x_evm_defconf:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
ONFIG_DRIVER_TI_CPSW=y
CONFIG_SPI=y
CONFIG_DM_SPI=y
CONFIG_OMAP3_SPI=y
CONFIG_TIMER=y
CONFIG_OMAP_TIMER=y
CONFIG_USB=y
...
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We see that the boot is going to bring in the usb, spi, etc.
