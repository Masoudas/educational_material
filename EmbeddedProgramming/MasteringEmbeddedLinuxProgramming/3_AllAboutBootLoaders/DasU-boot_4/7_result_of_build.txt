After build is complete, we see the SPL file named MLO in the build folder.

Moreover, the TPL files can be found as follows:
    -   u-boot: U-Boot in ELF object format, suitable for use with a debugger
    -   u-boot.map: The symbol table
    -   u-boot.bin: U-Boot in raw binary format, suitable for running on your device
    -   u-boot.img: This is u-boot.bin with a U-Boot header added, suitable for uploading to a running copy 
        of U-Boot
    -   u-boot.srec: U-Boot in Motorola S-record (SRECORD or SRE) format, suitable for transferring over a 
        serial connection
