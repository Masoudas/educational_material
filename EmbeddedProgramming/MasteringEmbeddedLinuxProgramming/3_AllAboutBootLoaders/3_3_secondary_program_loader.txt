The Secondary Program Loader (SPL) must set up the memory controller and other essential parts of the system 
preparatory to loading the Tertiary Program Loader (TPL) into DRAM. The functionality of the SPL is limited by 
the size of the SRAM (me: 128KB in case of ARM3358). It can read a program from a list of storage devices, as 
can the ROM code, once again using pre-programmed offsets from the start of a flash device. If the SPL has file 
system drivers built in, it can read well known file names, such as u-boot.img, from a disk partition. The SPL 
usually doesn't allow for any user interaction, but it may print version information and progress messages, 
which you can see on the console. (me: Actually, we can print customary boot messages in the secondary stage,
which we shall try later.)

Note that the uboot image is written in the very first addresses of the DRAM.

At the end of the second phase, the TPL is present in DRAM, and the SPL can make a jump to that area.
