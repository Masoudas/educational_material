When it comes to manufacturers:
    -   ti: I think stands for Texas Instruments, that produces ARM processors. So something like "ti am33xx"
        stands for texas instruments, arm processor, then version.
    -   fsl: Stands for FreeScaLe. So something like fsl MPC8349EMITX stands for free scale, MPC processor or
        deriver, then version.
