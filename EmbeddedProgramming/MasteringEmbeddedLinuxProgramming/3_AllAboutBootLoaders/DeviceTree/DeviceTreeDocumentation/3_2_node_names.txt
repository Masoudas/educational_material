Each node in the devicetree is named according to the following convention:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
node-name@unit-address
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The node-name component specifies the name of the node. It shall be 1 to 31 characters in length and consist solely 
of characters from the set of characters (including +, -, etc)
The node-name shall start with a lower or uppercase character and should describe the general class of device.


The unit-address component of the name is specific to the bus type on which the node sits. 
The root node does not have a node-name or unit-address. It is identified by a forward slash (/). Also, some
other nodes may not have adress (like multiple CPU cores)

Example: cpus node has children cpu@1 and cpu@2, which means it sits on these buses.
Hence for example, the path to core one of the cpu can be described as /cpus/cpu@1
