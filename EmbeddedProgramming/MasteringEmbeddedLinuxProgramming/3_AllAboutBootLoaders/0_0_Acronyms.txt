Once again, we need to go over the acronyms used in this chapter:

    -   MMC: Multi-Media Card. A device used for storage of information.
    -   eMMC: Apparently same as MMC, only difference is the way it's mounted physically.
    -   ROM: Read Only Memory, filled in by the vendor of CPU. For ARM CPUs it's inside the CPU.
    -   sRAM and dRAM: Static and Dynamic Random Access Memory. 
        -   SRAM is an on-chip memory whose access time is small while DRAM is an off-chip memory which has a large 
            access time. Therefore SRAM is faster than DRAM. DRAM is available in larger storage capacity while SRAM 
            is of smaller size. SRAM is expensive whereas DRAM is cheap.
        -   SRAM is used as cache memory. dRAM is used as main memory.
        -   RAM is known as Volatile memory because once power is lost, data is lost as well.
        Note that when it comes to application, both RAMs do the same thing, it's just that one is too expensive
        to make in large size.

    -   Flash memory: Electrical, non-volatile memory (does not use power to keep its data). SSD and HDD hard
        drives are both considered flash. NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express) is an interface to access flash 
        storage, which is why a df command would show that the partitions of the SDD hard drive I have on my 
        current PC is actually nvme0:
        
        $ df -h
        Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
        ...
        /dev/nvme0n1p5   59G   29G   27G  52% /

        NVMe is an interface protocol for accessing flash storage via a PCI Express (PCIe) bus. Unlike traditional 
        all-flash architectures, which are limited to a single, serial command queue, NVMe supports tens of thousands 
        of parallel queues, each with the ability to support tens of thousands of concurrent commands.
