Every project begins by obtaining, customizing, and deploying these four elements:
    - Toolchain: The compiler and other tools needed to create code for your target device. Everything else depends on the 
      toolchain.
    - Bootloader: The program that initializes the board and loads the Linux kernel.
    - Kernel: This is the heart of the system, managing system resources and interfacing with hardware.
    - Root filesystem: Contains the libraries and programs that are run once the kernel has completed its initialization.

Of course, there is also a fifth element, not mentioned here. That is the collection of programs specific to your embedded 
application which make the device do whatever it is supposed to do, be it weigh groceries, display movies, control a robot, or 
fly a drone.

Typically, you will be offered some or all of these elements as a package when you buy your SoC or board. But, for the reasons 
mentioned in the preceding paragraph, they may not be the best choices for you. Later, we will see two tools that automate the 
whole process: Buildroot and the Yocto Project.
