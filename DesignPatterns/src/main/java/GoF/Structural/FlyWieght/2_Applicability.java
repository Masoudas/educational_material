/**
 * Use Flyweight when:
 * 
 * 1- There's many instances of the same object in the program.
 * 
 * 2- There's memory issues because of 1.
 * 
 * 3- Extrinsic and intrinsic state of a class can be separated.
 * 
 * 4- Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects 
 * once extrinsic state is removed.
 * 
 * 5- Identity equations are not important in the context of the application.
 * This is because many objects would share the same instance.
