XML documents form a tree structure that starts at "the root" and branches to "the leaves".

XML documents are formed as element trees. An XML tree starts at a root element and branches from the root to 
child elements. All elements can have sub elements (child elements):

<root>
  <child>
    <subchild>.....</subchild>
  </child>
</root>

The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships between elements. Parents have 
children. Children have parents. Siblings are children on the same level (brothers and sisters). All elements can 
have text content (Harry Potter) and attributes (category="cooking").

The xml prolog is as follows:

The XML prolog is optional. If it exists, it must come first in the document. XML documents can contain 
international characters, like Norwegian øæå or French êèé. To avoid errors, you should specify the encoding 
used, or save your XML files as UTF-8.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

The next element is the root element:
<root> </root>

All xml elements must have a closing tag, and they are also case specific. XML elements must be properly nested
inside one another:
