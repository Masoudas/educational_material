In HTML, the <a> element defines a hyperlink. However, this is not how it works in XML. In XML documents, you can 
use whatever element names you want - therefore it is impossible for browsers to predict what link elements will 
be called in XML documents.

Below is a simple example of how to use XLink to create links in an XML document:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<homepages xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
  <homepage xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</homepage>
  <homepage xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.w3.org">Visit W3C</homepage>
</homepages>

To get access to the XLink features we must declare the XLink namespace. The XLink namespace is: 
"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink". The xlink:type and the xlink:href attributes in the <homepage> elements come from 
the XLink namespace. The xlink:type="simple" creates a simple "HTML-like" link (means "click here to go there").

The xlink:href attribute specifies the URL to link to.

Consider the following example, where 'xlink:show="new"' means open a new window on click.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
