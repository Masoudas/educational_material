In XPath, there are seven kinds of nodes: element, attribute, text, namespace, processing-instruction, comment, 
and document nodes. XML documents are treated as trees of nodes. The topmost element of the tree is called the 
root element.

Look at the following XML document:

%%%%%%%%%%
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<bookstore>
  <book>
    <title lang="en">Harry Potter</title>
    <author>J K. Rowling</author>
    <year>2005</year>
    <price>29.99</price>
  </book>
</bookstore>
%%%%%%%%%%

Here are example nodes:

<bookstore> (root element node)

<author>J K. Rowling</author> (element node)

lang="en" (attribute node)

	-	Atomic values are nodes with no children or parent. Examples are "en", or J K. Rowling.
	-	Items are atomic values or nodes.
