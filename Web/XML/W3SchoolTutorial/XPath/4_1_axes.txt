An axis represents a relationship to the context (current) node, and is used to locate nodes relative to that node 
on the tree.

AxisName			Result
ancestor			Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node
ancestor-or-self	Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node and the current node itself
attribute			Selects all attributes of the current node
child				Selects all children of the current node
descendant			Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node
descendant-or-self	Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node and the current node itself
following			Selects everything in the document after the closing tag of the current node
following-sibling	Selects all siblings after the current node
namespace			Selects all namespace nodes of the current node
parent				Selects the parent of the current node
preceding			Selects all nodes that appear before the current node in the document, except ancestors, 
					attribute nodes and namespace nodes
preceding-sibling	Selects all siblings before the current node
self				Selects the current node

	-	Location Path Expression
A location path can be absolute or relative.
An absolute location path starts with a slash ( / ) and a relative location path does not. In both cases the 
location path consists of one or more steps, each separated by a slash.

A step consists of:
	*	an axis (defines the tree-relationship between the selected nodes and the current node)
	*	a node-test (identifies a node within an axis)
	*	zero or more predicates (to further refine the selected node-set)

An step has the syntax:
axisname::nodetest[predicate]
