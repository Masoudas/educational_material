	-	DTD
DTD stands for Document Type Definition. A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an 
XML document.

The DOCTYPE declaration above an xml contains a reference to a DTD file. 

	-	XML DTD
The purpose of a DTD is to define the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. For
example:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!DOCTYPE note
[
<!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)>
<!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
]>

The DTD above is interpreted like this:

	-	!DOCTYPE note -  Defines that the root element of the document is note
	-	!ELEMENT note - Defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
	-	!ELEMENT to - Defines the to element to be of type "#PCDATA"
	-	!ELEMENT from - Defines the from element to be of type "#PCDATA"
	-	!ELEMENT heading  - Defines the heading element to be of type "#PCDATA"
	-	!ELEMENT body - Defines the body element to be of type "#PCDATA"


With a DTD, independent groups of people can agree to use a standard DTD for interchanging data. With a DTD, you 
can verify that the data you receive from the outside world is valid. You can also use a DTD to verify your own 
data.

XML does not require a DTD. When you are experimenting with XML, or when you are working with small XML files, 
creating DTDs may be a waste of time.
