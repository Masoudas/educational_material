	-	XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
	-	XML is a markup language much like HTML
	-	XML was designed to store and transport data
	-	XML was designed to be self-descriptive
	-	XML is a W3C Recommendation

XML is different from HTML:
XML and HTML were designed with different goals:
	-	XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
	-	HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
	-	XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

The XML language has no predefined tags.
The tags (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of 
the XML document.

HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.

XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed. The same XML data can be used in many different 
presentation scenarios. Because of this, with XML, there is a full separation between data and presentation.
