An XML element is everything from (including) the element's start tag to (including) the element's end tag.

XML elements must follow these naming rules:
	-	Element names are case-sensitive
	-	Element names must start with a letter or underscore
	-	Element names cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc)
	-	Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods
	-	Element names cannot contain spaces

Note that elements are extensible (where the x comes from!) Consider the following element:
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>

Suppose an app works with this. Then, it must be able to work with the following as well:
<note>
  <date>2008-01-10</date>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
