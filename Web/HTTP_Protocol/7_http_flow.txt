When a client wants to communicate with a server, either the final server or an intermediate proxy, it performs the following steps:

	-	Open a TCP connection: The TCP connection is used to send a request, or several, and receive an answer. 
	The client may open a new connection, reuse an existing connection, or open several TCP connections to the 
	servers.

	-	Send an HTTP message: HTTP messages (before HTTP/2) are human-readable. With HTTP/2, these simple messages 
	are encapsulated in frames, making them impossible to read directly, but the principle remains the same. For 
	example:
	######
	GET / HTTP/1.1
	Host: developer.mozilla.org
	Accept-Language: fr
	######

	-	Read the response sent by the server, such as:
	######
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Date: Sat, 09 Oct 2010 14:28:02 GMT
	Server: Apache
	Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Dec 2009 20:18:22 GMT
	ETag: "51142bc1-7449-479b075b2891b"
	Accept-Ranges: bytes
	Content-Length: 29769
	Content-Type: text/html
	######
