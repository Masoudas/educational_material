We have four famous methods, which are also called verbs:
	-	Get: Usually used to fetch data from a server.
	-	Post: Updating resources or content usually.
	-	Delete
	-	Put: Create resources or content.

The CRUD operations stand for create, read, update, delete.

On the other hand:
	-	Safe methods: Get, because fetching does not change data.
	-	Unsafe methods: Put, Post, Delete are unsafe.
