Interestingly enough, the object file machine instructions depend not only on the machine hardware, but also the
OS as well. Normally, various OS form the machine code separately (like Windows and Linux, or even different
versions of Linux.) As such, when we speak about the platform, we mean both the hardware and the OS (Me: which is
why we have CMake for cross-platform compilation.)

We usually say that object files, hence the assembler generating them, are platform-specific. In Linux, we use the 
Executable and Linking Format (ELF). As the name implies, all executable files, object files, and shared libraries 
should use this format. In other words, in Linux, the assembler produces ELF object files. In the upcoming chapter, 
Object Files, we will discuss object files and their formats in greater detail.
