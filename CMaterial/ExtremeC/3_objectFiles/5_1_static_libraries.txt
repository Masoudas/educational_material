Recall that static libraries are essentialy archives of relocatable object files. As such, there's no ELF associated
with a static library. Also recall that to create a static library, we first assemble each object file, and then
use the 'ar' archiver to archive the files:

$ gcc -c file1.c -o file1.o
...
% ar rcs lib.a file1.o file2.o ...

Note that ar does not necessarily create a compressed archive for us. However, we can use it to archive any sort
of files.

To see the content of an archive, use the 't' option:
$ ar t lib.a
file1.o
file2.o
...

Recall also that to use this library, we need its header files separately to be used in the target project. Then
in the link stage, we give the path tho this library.
