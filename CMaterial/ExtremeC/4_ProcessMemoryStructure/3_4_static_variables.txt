Note that static variables defined inside the functions will be stored in either bss or data section, depending
on the OS as well as whether the variables are initialized or not.

void func() {
	static int i;
	static int j = 1;
}

To elaborate more on how this is done, at runtime, the func function has access to these variables located in either 
the Data segment or the BSS segment, which has a static lifetime. That's basically why these variables are called 
static.
