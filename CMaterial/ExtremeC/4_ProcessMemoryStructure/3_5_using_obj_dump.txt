We can use objdump in a Unix environment to directly check the content of the BSS and DATA sections.

Consider for example:

int	x = 33;	// 0x21;
int	y = 0x12153467;
char z[6] = "ABCDE";

int main(int argc, char**argv) {
	return 0;
}

Now, either by dumping the object directly or using the -s and -j options we get:
$ objdump -s -j program
 4000 00000000 00000000 08400000 00000000  .........@......
 4010 21000000 67341512 41424344 4500      !...g4..ABCDE. 

Notice that the first column here is the address column in hex, and the rest are the content of the address, again
in Hex. Notice that on the right, we have the interpretation as chars. Notice also the value 21 which starts at
address 4010. Notice that each line contains 16 bytes exactly.

Also, notice the endianness of the data stored. The data 0x00000021 is stored as 21000000, which implies that our
system is little indian.
