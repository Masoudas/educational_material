The data segment as we discussed is responsible allocating memory to initialized global variables. For example,
consider the following:

int global_var1;
int global_var2;
int global_var3 = 0;
double global_var4 = 4.5;
char global_var5 = 'A';

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	return 0;
}

$ size program
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   1418     553      20    1991     7c7 program
  
Again, we see that more pages are allocated to the data section compared to the original program. This time, however
the increase in size corresponds exactly to the number of bytes (meaning 9.)

Me: We can see that the size of bss has also increased for some unGodly reason!
