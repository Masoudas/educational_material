Apparently memory allocation is not just confined to malloc and free and calloc and etc. We can in fact use other
librarious for more elaborate strategies. Some of these memory allocator libraries are ptmalloc, tcmalloc, Haord, 
and dlmalloc.

Essentially, however, we want to avoid allocating and delocating to the extent possible, or as frequently as
possible.

Uaing memory pools is another solution in this regard, and can be used through predefined APIs that take care of
memory.
