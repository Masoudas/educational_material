Consider the following simple function:

int main(int argc, char** argv){
	return 0;
}

If we compile it, we get the following:
$ gcc main.c -o main.out

The first tool we can use to determine the size of the static memory is actually called size! Consider:

$ size main.out
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   1418     544       8    1970     7b2 program

As you see, we have Text, Data, and BSS segments as part of the static layout. The shown sizes are in bytes.
The total sum is also given in decimal and hex.

If on the other hand, we compiled this code in MacOS, we'd get:
__TEXT __DATA __OBJC others dec hex
4096 	0	0 4294971392 4294975488 100002000
