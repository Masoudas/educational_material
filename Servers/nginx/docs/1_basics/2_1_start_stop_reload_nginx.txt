To start nginx, run the executable file. Once nginx is started, it can be controlled by invoking the executable with the -s parameter. Use the following syntax:

$ nginx -s signal
Where signal may be one of the following:

    -   stop — fast shutdown
    -   quit — graceful shutdown
    -   reload — reloading the configuration file
    -   reopen — reopening the log files

For example, to stop nginx processes with waiting for the worker processes to finish serving current requests, the following command can be executed:

$ nginx -s quit
