For small teams, simply use sqlite.

To create a database and a user for gitea, first log into mysql as root, then ensure to write the local ip whenever creating dbs, or accounts, etc. This may cause problems when sshing to the server.

$ sudo mysql -u root
mysql> CREATE DATABASE gitea;
mysql> CREATE USER 'gitea'@'192.168.0.8' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON gitea.* TO 'gitea'@'192.168.0.8';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Finally, to ensure that the ip address of mysql is set to the local host (and not the loop back), add the following line to the /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf file:

bind-address           = 0.0.0.0
# skip-networking
