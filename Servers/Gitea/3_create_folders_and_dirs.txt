The official docs have suggested creating folders in the var folder (which is not on RAM!)

$ mkdir -p /var/lib/gitea/{custom,data,log}
$ chown -R gitea:gitea /var/lib/gitea/
$ chmod -R 750 /var/lib/gitea/
$ mkdir /etc/gitea
$ chown root:gitea /etc/gitea
$ chmod 770 /etc/gitea

Notice that the /etc/gitea folder has write permission for user gitea. We better change this after configration is complete.

Lastly, we need to copy the executable into a proper location, which is. Make it executable as well:
$ sudo chmod +x gitea
$ cp gitea /usr/local/bin
