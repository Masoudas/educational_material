The owrking directory is where all the repos are created.

This is a toughy! On the one hand, I believe we should set this to the homer folder of gitea. However, because we disable the password, then we may have access to it without password.

The default option is to set it in /var/lib/gitea, which is root protected.

Where can we define the working directory? In the service file, or simply when running gitea as:
GITEA_WORK_DIR=/var/lib/gitea/ /usr/local/bin/gitea web -c /etc/gitea/app.ini
