NOTE: Once you know it, it all makes sense.

To build the image and push it to the registery, we need to create a .gitlab-ci.yml file.

GitLab provides a container registry for each project. You can explore the container registry by going to Packages & Registries > Container Registry in your GitLab project. The final step in your pipeline is to log in to your server, pull the latest Docker image, remove the old container, and start a new container.

Here's the content of the '.gitlab-ci.yml' file in one look. The aim is to simply build the project, so we're building it:
###################
publish:
  image: docker:latest
  
  stage: build
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - docker build -t $TAG_COMMIT -t $TAG_LATEST .
    - docker login -u gitlab-ci-token -p $CI_BUILD_TOKEN $CI_REGISTRY
    - docker push $TAG_COMMIT
    - docker push $TAG_LATEST
###################
Next, we shall describe each line:

    -   script: Where we actually build the repositry using the latest commit, and then log in and add to the image registery of the gitlab.
