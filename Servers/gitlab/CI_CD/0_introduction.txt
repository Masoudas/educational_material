In this tutorial youâ€™ll build a continuous deployment pipeline with GitLab. You will configure the pipeline to build a Docker image, push it to the GitLab container registry, and deploy it to your server using SSH. The pipeline will run for each commit pushed to the repository.

NOTE: The distinction between building the docker image and sending it to the gitlab repo (its image registery) and then deploying it in the destination machine is crucial here.

QUESTION: I wonder if we build the master branch, or we can build other branches as well.
