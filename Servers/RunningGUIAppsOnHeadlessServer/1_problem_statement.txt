Say we have a a GUI application that needs to run on a linux server machine. However, we want the GUI to appear on our current machine (say a Windows machine or a Linux machine with GUI.) What we can do is to forward the GUI part to the current machine, and let it render the graphics.

The mechanism for this is called X11 forwarding.

X11 forwarding is a mechanism that allows a user to start up remote applications but forward the application display to your local Windows machine.
