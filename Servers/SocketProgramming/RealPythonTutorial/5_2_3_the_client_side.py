"""
Now take a look at the multi-connection client, multiconn-client.py. Itâ€™s very similar to the server, but instead of listening for connections, it starts by initiating connections via start_connections():

num_conns is read from the command-line and is the number of connections to create to the server. Just like the server, each socket is set to non-blocking mode.

You use .connect_ex() instead of .connect() because .connect() would immediately raise a BlockingIOError exception. The .connect_ex() method initially returns an error indicator, errno.EINPROGRESS, instead of raising an exception that would interfere with the connection in progress. Once the connection is completed, the socket is ready for reading and writing and is returned by .select().

After the socket is set up, the data you want to store with the socket is created using SimpleNamespace. The messages that the client will send to the server are copied using messages.copy() because each connection will call socket.send() and modify the list. Everything needed to keep track of what the client needs to send, has sent, and has received, including the total number of bytes in the messages, is stored in the object data.
