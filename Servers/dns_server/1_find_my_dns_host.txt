Say I have a domain name, like sircotech.ir, and I want to figure out my dns host (who's the dns provider for my domain.) All I need to do is to go to who.is, and then type in my domain name, and then I can see it under label server:

domain:		sircotech.ir
ascii:		sircotech.ir
nserver:	dns1.mizbanfadns.net
nserver:	dns2.mizbanfadns.net
nserver:	dns3.mizbanfadns.net
nserver:	dns4.mizbanfadns.net
source:		IRNIC # Filtered

We see that it is `dns1.mizbanfadns.net` (I guess :D)
