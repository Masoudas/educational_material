-- Configuration
There are many ways to configure BIND9. Some of the most common configurations are a caching nameserver, primary server, and secondary server.

    -   When configured as a caching nameserver BIND9 will find the answer to name queries and remember the answer when the domain is queried again.

    -   As a primary server, BIND9 reads the data for a zone from a file on its host and is authoritative for that zone.

    -   As a secondary server, BIND9 gets the zone data from another nameserver that is authoritative for the zone.
