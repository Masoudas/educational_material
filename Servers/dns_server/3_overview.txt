The DNS configuration files are stored in the /etc/bind directory. The primary configuration file is /etc/bind/named.conf, which in the layout provided by the package just includes these files.

    -   /etc/bind/named.conf.options: global DNS options
    -   /etc/bind/named.conf.local: for your zones
    -   /etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones: default zones such as localhost, its reverse, and the root hints
    
The root nameservers used to be described in the file /etc/bind/db.root. This is now provided instead by the /usr/share/dns/root.hints file shipped with the dns-root-data package, and is referenced in the named.conf.default-zones configuration file above.

It is possible to configure the same server to be a caching name server, primary, and secondary: it all depends on the zones it is serving. A server can be the Start of Authority (SOA) for one zone, while providing secondary service for another zone. All the while providing caching services for hosts on the local LAN.
