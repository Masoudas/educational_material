In this tutorial, we assume that the project and indexer are on the same machine. There was a way to upload a project without actually building it. But we're going to upload after a build.

Consider the following project:

    -   pysober.py The module to be released.
    -   setup.py
    -   MANIFEST.in
    -   tox.ini Tox configuration file required by devpi test
    -   ./test/conftest.py Adds a –project-version option
    -   ./test/test_pysober.py
    -   ./doc/Makefile The documentation project which looks like this Welcome to pysober’s documentation!
    -   ./doc/source/overview.rst
    -   ./doc/source/index.rst
    -   ./doc/source/conf.py



# Install a package from pypi
$ devpi install lazy

Now, say we wanted to upload our pysober project.
$ cd pysober ; python setup.py sdist

Here's our built project:
$ ls pysober/dist
pysober-0.2.0.tar.gz

Finally, we do as follows:
$ devpi upload --from-dir pysober/dist

Now, to upload to a remote indexer, we just need to provide the url:

To remove a package, we just need to do as follows:
$ devpi remove -y package==version
