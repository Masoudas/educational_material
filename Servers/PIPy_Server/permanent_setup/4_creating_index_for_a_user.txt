An index is what is available for a user. It starts after /root/pypi

Now, there are two concepts here, volatile and non-volatile indexes.
    -   Volatile indexes are used for development, and they can change
    -   non-Volatile are production indexes.

Here's how to create both:

$ devpi use http://localhost:4040
$ devpi login sirco --password ...
$ devpi index -c prod volatile=False
$ devpi index -c dev bases=/sirco/prod volatile=True

Now, we can get the json of what's going on:
$ devpi getjson /sirco/dev


Notice also that we can define mirros for our indexes as well.

We can select an index as follows:
$ devpi user /sirco/dev

Finally, we must directly add the base to our indexes:
$ devpi index sirco/prod bases+=root/pypi
$ devpi index sirco/dev bases+=root/pypi
