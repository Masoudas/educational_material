Note that there are essentially four commands concerning devpi servers:

    - devpi-config:   To configure the server according to our desires.
    - devpi-init:   To initialize the server instance based on our requirements
    - devpi-server: To run the server instance that we have configured
    - devpi:    To work with our server instance.

Notice that devpi is installed as local binaries for each user that wishes to install this product, in the .local/bin folder. If the root wants to implement it, then root must install it. This is completely different from the root command that is the root of our indexing.

Whomever install it is the user for whom the service file must be defined.

[Service]
Restart=on-success
# ExecStart:
# - shall point to existing devpi-server executable
# - shall not use the deprecated `--start`. We want the devpi-server to start in foreground
ExecStart=/home/sirco/.local/bin/devpi-server -c /home/sirco/devpi-server/devpi-server.yaml
# set User according to user which is able to run the devpi-server
User=sirco      # Don't set this to root. Set it to the user that runs it.
