Ok, this is the part which baffled me for a day.

If we check out the urls for an index, we see that:
$ devpi use sirco/dev
$ devpi use --urls
       index: http://192.168.0.8:4040/sirco/dev
       simpleindex: http://192.168.0.8:4040/sirco/dev/+simple/
       pypisubmit: http://192.168.0.8:4040/sirco/dev/
       login: http://192.168.0.8:4040/+login
/home/sirco/.pip/pip.conf: no config file exists
~/.pydistutils.cfg     : no config file exists
~/.buildout/default.cfg: no config file exists


We see that to submit packages, we need to use the pypisubmit address. Otherwise, our packages will not be published there. As such, here's an example of how we publish a package using poetry:

$ poetry config repositories.sirco http://192.168.0.8:4040/sirco/dev/
$ poetry publish -r sirco
