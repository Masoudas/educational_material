Install or upgrade devpi-server (I put the sudo myself, so that everything can be done as super user.):

$ sudo pip install -U devpi-server
$ sudo pip install -U devpi-web   

Note that everything is installed under ~/.local/bin.

If you intend to expose your server to the internet, you should read about securing it properly at 
https://devpi.net/docs/devpi/devpi/latest/+doc/adminman/security.html

First, I create a folder, say devpi-server in a suitable location (/var works if we run the above commands as root)

$ mkdir devpi-server

Then, I need to create the following yaml configuration file:
# devpi-server.yaml
devpi-server:
  serverdir: /var/devpi-server/devpi-server
#  secretfile: /var/devpi-server/secret
  host: localhost
  port: 8080

This configuration file is used for every run of the project. Especially below, in the service file:

Note: There's a program to generate secrets, called devpi-gen-secret. I guess we can use it to generate secrets. Otherwise, we need to comment the secret line.  

Now, initialize the server INSIDE the devpi-server as follows:

$ devpi-init -c devpi-server

Then, run the server as follows:

$ devpi-server -c devpi-server

Finally, we may connect to the server as follows:

$ devpi use http://localhost:4040
